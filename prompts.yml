    # query:
    You will be provided with excerpts from research papers relating to photovoltaics. Your primary objective is to accurately extract data from the excerpt.
    Each dataset must include the following parameters: Absorber Layer, Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE), Open-circuit Voltage (Voc), Short-circuit Current (Jsc), and Fill Factor (FF).
    
    # prompt:
    Read the provided excerpt from a research paper and extract the relevant and correct values in the f table format:
    Format:

            "Absorber Layer": "<Chemical Composition or Material Name>",
            "PCE": "<Value in %> %",
            "Voc": "<Value in V> V",
            "Isc": "<Value in mA/cm2> mA/cm2",
            "FF": "<Value in %> %"

    For missing values, enter "N/A".

    Follow the given format STRICTLY.
    Fill in complete sets only and omit incomplete data
    Do not include incomplete sets of data.

    Using the context provided below, elaborate on the roles played by different cell types as if you were creating rules for an agent-based model, and factors in muscle repair and regeneration. Structure your response in a table with three columns:
    1) Embedding numbers, 
    2) Source text name, 
    and 3) Detailed roles and interactions of cell types like satellite cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, neutrophils, cytokines, and growth factors. Provide multiple entries. 

    For each cell type or cytokine or growth factor mentioned, focusing on their specific effects during the cell cycle phases and their interactions during the process of muscle repair.\n\n"
