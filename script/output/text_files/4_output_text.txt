observed

We may thus reasonably infer that the
neutralization of acid rain over the gra(cid:173)
nitic and forested terrane of New En(cid:173)
gland is accomplished in low-order wa(cid:173)
tersheds by the two-step chemical pro(cid:173)
cess described above. The presence of
high concentrations of dissolved alumi(cid:173)
num has been reported for acidified wa(cid:173)
ters from a variety of environments in(cid:173)
cluding the alpine zone of New Hamp(cid:173)
shire (13), the Adirondack region (9), and
Norway (14). As long as strong acids
persist in solution, the neutralization re(cid:173)
actions proceed essentially as a base ex(cid:173)
change reaction at constant ionic strength
(Fig. 2). However, when the strong acids
are eventually neutralized, carbonic acid
will ionize and the ionic strength of the
system may increase through open-sys(cid:173)
tem carbonation reactions.

Some of the more general implications
of this mode of acid rain neutralization
include the following:
1) Hydrologically,

the effect of acid
rain on stream water quality will be evi(cid:173)
dent mainly in low-order drainage sys(cid:173)
tems, especially where the bedrock is
chemically unreactive as in an igneous

and metamorphic terrane. In the marble
belts of New England, acid rain neutral(cid:173)
ization is rapidly accomplished by the
solution of carbonate minerals
(15).
Probably no sustained acidifying effect
will be manifested on major streams, re(cid:173)
gardless of bedrock type.

2) As a consequence, lakes whose wa(cid:173)
tersheds are composed of igneous or
metamorphic bedrock and which receive
water from low-order streams will tend
to be acidified and rich in aluminum. In
general, it may be anticipated that alpine
and upland lakes will show this effect
more than lowland lakes or those that
receive mostly aged stream water or
groundwater, or both.

3) With respect to soils, the participa(cid:173)
tion of soil aluminum in the immed,iate
acid neutralization process probably dis(cid:173)
locates or otherwise disturbs t~e normal
order of soil formation (13). The soil and
regolith of the New England landscape
are presently acting as a large sump for
the absorption of excess strong acidity.
4) Geologically, no excessive chemical
weathering activity can be attributed to
acid rain over the northeastern United
States. The contemporary ionic denuda(cid:173)
tion rate of New England (0.22 eq/m 2
) is
well below the North American average
(0.38 eq/m 2) , despite the added com(cid:173)
ponent of strong acids washing out over
New England (2, 3).

2-Methyltetrahydrofuran-Lithium Hexa8uoroarsenate:
A Superior Electrolyte for the Secondary Lithium Electrode

Abstract. Rechargeable, high energy density lithium batteries require an efficient
lithium electrode. Earlier work with electrolytes based on propylene carbonate,
methyl acetate, and tetrahydrofuran yielded poor lithium electrode cycling effi(cid:173)
ciencies because of electrolyte reduction by lithium. Solutions of lithium hex(cid:173)
afluoroarsenate in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran are found to be remarkably stable to(cid:173)
ward lithium, resulting in cycling efficiencies that approach 98 percent. The ability of
2-methyltetrahydrofuran to resist reduction by lithium is thought to be based on the
position of its lowest unfilled molecular orbital relative to that of tetrahydrofuran.

The development of an ambient tem-
perature secondary battery employing a
Li negative has been actively pursued
over the past 20 years (1). The key tech-

nical problem precluding the implemen(cid:173)
tation of such batteries is the cycling be(cid:173)
havior of the Li electrode. Metallic Li
can be plated from organic media con-

taining Li+ ions onto a conducting sub-
strate with 100 percent efficiency (2).
However, anodic dissolution of the re-
actant is invariably less than 100 percent
efficient (2-4). The difference reflects re-
sidual Li metal electrically isolated from
the conducting substrate by insulating
films (1, 5). These films arise from the re-
action of freshly deposited Li with the
electrolyte and protect the metal from
further attack. The presence of such
filmed or "encapsulated" Li particles re-
sults in an irregular surface, which seri-
ously distorts the subsequent morpholo-
gy of the reactant. On the second cycle,
for example, Li nucleation and growth
proceed irregularly, the surface area of
the Li increases, the rate of reaction with
electrolyte increases, and more Li is iso-
lated. Thus, the effect of a small morpho-
logical perturbation on the first cycle is
compounded over several cycles, lead-
ing to ultimate electrode failure.

A well-behaved Li electrode is contin-
gent on the development of a medium ki-
netically, if not thermodynamically, inert
toward Li. Our work has involved the
study of a variety of aprotic organic
solvent and supporting electrolyte com-
binations, and the best results to date
have been achieved with cyclic ethers in
general and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-
Me-THF) in particular (6). In this report,
we compare solutions of LiAsF, in tet-
rahydrofuran (THF) and 2-Me-THF in
terms of their physical properties and
relative inertness toward Li.

At 25°C, the density and viscosity val-
ues for 2-Me-THF correspond closely to
those of THF: 0.880 g/cm3 and 0.461 cP
(7) compared to 0.848 g/cm3 and 0.457 cP
(8), respectively. However, the addition
of a methyl group alpha to the oxygen
atom of THF seriously affects solution
conductivity. The specific conductance
at 25°C of IM LiAsF6 in cyclic ether was
found to be 3.0 x 10-3 ohm-1 cm-1 for 2-
Me-THF and 13.7 x 10-3 ohm-1 cm-' for
THF. The almost fivefold reduction in
conductivity on going from THF to 2-

500

Me-THF electrolyte may be ascribed to
increased ion pairing in the latter (7, 8).
Possibly, the steric bulk of the 2-methyl
group inhibits coordination between Li+
and the nonbonding orbitals on the oxy-
gen atom of 2-Me-THF. Thus, Li+ is not
solvated as completely by 2-Me-THF as
it is by THF. We note that the con-
ductivities (IM LiAsF6, 25°C) of elec-
trolytes made with 3-Me-THF and 2,5-
di-methyltetrahydrofuran
(2,5-di-Me-
THF) straddle that for 2-Me-THF (7.4 x
10-3 and 0.2 x 10-3 ohm-1 cm-1, re-
spectively), which is consistent with this
model. Accordingly, the use of elec-
trolytes
alkylated THF's
may be restricted to low-rate (< 10 mA/
cm2) battery applications. Although high
conductivity is an important consid-
eration in choosing an electrolyte, the
fundamental criterion in the selection
process is stability toward Li, and in this
regard 2-Me-THF is a step forward.

The stability of these cyclic ethers to-

in-
volved the incubation of Li foil with elec-
trolyte at 71°C. The onset of a Li-elec-
trolyte reaction is seen as corrosion pro-
ducts on the Li foil and concurrent
yellowing of the electrolyte. Dynamic
conditions were achieved by cycling Li
to and from Li or Ni substrates at 25°C.
In this case, a fresh Li surface comes in-
to contact with electrolyte on every
cycle. Lithium-electrolyte reactivity was
noted in terms of a loss of cycling effi-
ciency (defined as charge stripped di-
vided by charge plated) with increasing
cycle number.

Static tests revealed that 2-Me-THF
distilled from benzophenone ketyl and
sealed in Pyrex showed no visible sign of
reaction over a 10-month storage period.
Similarly treated THF reacted with Li in
just 3 days, and whereas solutions of
LiAsF6 and 2-Me-THF were stable over
a 13-month period, LiAsF6-THF media
reacted after 25 days. Presumably, impu-
rities introduced by the LiAsF6 form
protective films (9), or the salt itself can
scavenge reactive intermediates. The
major reduction product in the reaction
of THF with Li was found to be n-buta-
nol from lithium n-butoxide after hydrol-
ysis (10).

A more stringent test of electrolyte in-
ertness involves the dynamic cycling of
Li to and from a conducting substrate.
This mimics the charge and discharge
characteristics of the Li electrode in a
secondary cell. Good cycling efficiency
can be achieved only if the electrolyte is
kinetically stable to Li. This requires an
absence of reactive impurities as well as
the chemical compatibility of salt and

efficiencies of THF and 2-Me-THF elec-
trolytes on Ni are presented as a function
of cycle number for 1.1 C/cm2 Li plates.
(Although 50 to 100 C/cm2 of Li would
nominally be cycled in a practical cell,
thin plates are useful in rapidly assessing
the quality of an electrolyte. Cycling of
thin plates many times exacerbates con-
ditions leading to inefficiencies and elec-
trode failure.) On the tenth cycle run in
THF-based electrolyte, 80 percent of the
Li plated is encapsulated by films and
lost to anodic dissolution. By compari-
son, only 7 percent of Li plated from 2-
Me-THF-based electrolyte is electrically
isolated. This electrolyte nevertheless
does degrade with cycling number, as
evidenced by the decay of cycling effi-
ciency. Either reactive impurities or a
very slow reaction of 2-Me-THF with Li
yields products that perturb the mor-
phology of subsequent plates.

cycle, but an average efficiency (E) can

plates more Li onto the Ni substrate than
is stripped on the succeeding cycles.
Subsequent cycles proceed at what ap-
pears to be 100 percent efficiency until
the excess Li is consumed. For example,
if, over the course of 100 1 C/cm2 cycles,
1 C/cm2 excess Li is consumed, the aver-
age efficiency per cycle is 99 percent.
For 2-Me-THF electrolyte, the Li-on-Li
cycling experiment gave an E value of 96
percent (1.1 C/cm2 plates at 5 mA/cm2;
3.4 C/cm2 excess Li). This value is signif-
icantly better than those achieved with
electrolytes prepared from LiAsF6 and
THF (88 percent), propylene carbonate
(84 percent) (11), and methyl acetate (60
percent) (12). Moreover, the average cy-
cling efficiency may be improved by
lowering the current density. We ob-
serve that E increases from 96.0 to 97.4

from 5.0 to 0.9 mA/cm2.

The cycling behavior of the Li elec-
trode is generally better on Li than on Ni
or other substrates. One possible reason
for this is that the deposit is nucleated
much more easily and is therefore much
more uniform with a Li substrate. Lith-
ium may also be less active as an elec-
trode for the (catalyzed) electrochemical
reduction of the solvent than is, say, Ni.
Another test of a solvent's suitability
as a Li battery medium is its reactivity
with plated Li on open-circuit storage.
This assesses the intrinsic reactivity of
Li with solvent, and the achievement of
low reaction rates is a necessary condi-
tion for a satisfactory shelf life. The ex-
periment consists of plating 1.1 C/cm2
onto a Ni substrate, and then switching
the cell to open circuit. After a pre-
determined time, the Li plate is elec-
trostripped and the
deter-
mined.

Figure 2 compares data obtained from
LiAsF6-based THF and 2-Me-THF elec-
trolytes. After 96 hours on open circuit,
almost 70 percent of Li plated from the 2-
Me-THF electrolyte is electroaccessible.
With THF, however, all of the plated Li
is isolated after 48 hours. These data
translate into average isolation rates of
tA/cm2 (2-Me-THF, 96 hours) and
1.1
8.3 gA/cm2 (THF, 24 hours). At 24
hours, the isolation rate for 2-Me-THF is
1.3 gA/cm2, almost an order of magni-
tude lower than that calculated for THF.
Data points at 16 and 24 hours appear to
be anomalously high and require com-
ment. In all of our work with cyclic ether
electrolytes
we
have observed a recontacting phenome-
non whereby some Li lost to encapsula-
tion reactions may be recovered by stor-
age on open circuit (9). We believe that
this occurs in these experiments.

We propose that THF reacts with Li by a
rate-determining
transfer
from Li to the lowest unfilled molecular
orbital (LUMO) centered on the elec-
tronegative oxygen atom. The ease of
this transfer is largely determined by the
energy of that vacant orbital (13). Thus,
by raising the energy of the LUMO, it
becomes more difficult to transfer an
electron into it.

The energy of the LUMO about the

oxygen atom of THF can be perturbed
upward by locating an electron-donating
group in the 2-position adjacent to the
oxygen. The influence of additional elec-
tron density on the oxygen atom raises
the activation energy required to form
the anion radical. Since a methyl group is
known to
density
through covalent bonds (14), the 2-Me-
THF anion radical becomes more diffi-
cult to form. In consonance with this
model, preliminary static and dynamic
experiments indicate that 3-Me-THF is
as reactive as THF, whereas 2,5-di-Me-
THF is at least as inert as 2-Me-THF.

Tetrahydrofuran is known to undergo
reduction via alpha proton abstraction
by a strong base (15). Thus, a methyl
group in the 2-position could conceiv-
ably shield one side of the ring from at-
tack. This effectively halves the number
of available hydrogens, which in turn
would retard the reaction rate. We do
not believe, however, that the large dis-
parity between THF and 2-Me-THF re-
activity may be accounted for by the sta-

On the basis of the static tests at 710C,
the dynamic Li-on-Li cycling experi-

it appears that we have the basis for a

to those achieved with 1.1 C/cm2 plates.

Cement Line Motion in Bone

Abstract. Compact bovine bone subjected to constant torsional loadfor long peri-
ods of time exhibits large anelastic effects. Displacements occur at the cement lines
and are responsible for part or all of the long-term deformation. The absence of an
asymptotic creep strain is consistent with an interpretation of the cement line as a
viscous interface.

The

present

investigation

demon-
strates that large anelastic deformations
occur in specimens of bone loaded in tor-
sion for long periods, that displacements
occur at the cement lines, and that these
displacements appear to be responsible
for much of the time-dependent deforma-
tion. The results constitute the first clear
experimental evidence of viscous behav-
ior of the cement line.

Anelastic mechanical response has
been observed in all biological materials
studied thus far with the possible ex-
ception of dental enamel and echinoderm
skeletons. Anelastic (or viscoelastic) be-
havior entails dissipation of energy in dy-
namic loading, conversion of this energy
to other forms, and continued deforma-
tion (creep) in response to quasi-static
loading. In bone such behavior has been
