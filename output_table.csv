1,Amadio et al. (1992),"Satellite cells: Quiescent in normal conditions, activated upon injury to proliferate and differentiate into myoblasts. Interact with fibroblasts to produce ECM proteins for muscle regeneration."
2,Amadio et al. (1992),Fibroblasts: Produce ECM proteins such as collagen and fibronectin to support muscle regeneration. Interact with satellite cells to facilitate their activation and differentiation.
3,Best et al. (1994),"Macrophages: Phagocytose damaged muscle tissue and debris, promoting clearance and regeneration. Produce cytokines that stimulate the immune response and modulate inflammation."
4,Butler et al. (1984),"Neutrophils: Initially respond to injury by phagocytosing bacteria and other foreign substances, but can also contribute to tissue damage through release of reactive oxygen species."
5,Crowninshield et al. (1976),"Cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β): Released by activated immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, to modulate the immune response and promote inflammation. Can also stimulate fibroblast activation and ECM production."
6,Durelli et al. (1958),"Growth factors (e.g., PDGF, FGF): Released by activated immune cells and platelets to stimulate fibroblast proliferation and migration, promoting ECM production and tissue repair."
7,Fischer (1932),"Myoblasts: Differentiated from satellite cells, these cells proliferate and fuse to form new muscle fibers. Interact with ECM proteins produced by fibroblasts to support muscle regeneration."
