The  use  of  multilayer  p-graphene  as  hole  transporting  layer  has  been  successfully  shown  to 
improve the performance of perovskite solar cell. The structure of p-graphene/CH3NH3PbI3/n-cSi 
is designed and simulated in AFORS-HET software. We optimized the parameters of single layer p- 
graphene and obtained power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.21% under an illumination of AM 
1.5G. With an increase in the number of p-graphene layers, the PCE falls down to 10.01%. The 
optimization of active layer parameters increases the PCE up to 12.27%. Further optimization of 
n-cSi parameters lead to the highest PCE of 16.75%. A significant effect of the operating tem-
perature on the solar cell performance is observed. The effect of textured front surface on the solar 
cell performance is also studied and a PCE of 17.90% is obtained for textured surface as compared 
to 16.75% for planar surface. Our studies indicated that p-graphene may act as an efficient hole 
transporting layer in perovskite solar cell.   
The organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received great attention over the recent years because of its 
tuneable band gap and high absorption coefficient that produce large PCE [1–5]. A typical structure of PSC consists of the perovskite 
layer sandwiched between an electron transporting layer (ETL) and a hole transporting layer (HTL) along with front and back contacts. 
The ETL materials are used to extract and transport the electrons from the perovskite layer to the corresponding electrode. TiO2 is a 
widely used ETL material for PSCs. However, TiO2 material has some disadvantages such as intrinsic low mobility and production of 
deep traps by ultraviolet light, which results in charge accumulation, recombination in this layer and numerous current-voltage 
hysteresis [6–10]. The holes generated in perovskite layer are extracted and transported by the HTL materials which are broadly 
classified into two types i.e. one is organic HTL and the other is inorganic HTL. These HTL materials are selected based on their HOMO 
level, optical properties along with its doping ability. The organic HTL 2, 20, 7, 7’ - tetrakis (N, N-DI-P-methoxypheny-amine)- 9,9’ - 
spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) is used for achieving large PCE [11]. The poly (3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene): polystyrene sulfonate 
(PEDOT: PSS) has also been employed as HTL in PSCs [12]. In contrast to the more expensive organic HTL materials, the inorganic HTL 
materials such as transition metal oxides NiOx [13,14], CuOx [15,16] and CrOx [17,18] also established widespread interest.

Gagandeep et al.

Recently, it has been observed that graphene with its exceptional properties have positive impact on the development of PSCs. The 
low-cost graphene with its high carrier mobility (2 � 105 cm2/V⋅s) [19], large optical transparency [20], large thermal conductivity 
[21], and high melting point [22] can be employed either as HTL or ETL, or both, at the electrodes in PSCs. Watanabe et al. [23] studied 
the PSC by introducing the graphene as HTL in place of spiro-OMeTAD and obtained an efficiency of 7.1% with Jsc of 21.3 mA/cm2. 
They also compared the two PSC structures, i.e., FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/graphene/Au and FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMe-
TAD/Au. They found that the PSC structure based on graphene as HTL is more stable as compared to spiro-OMeTAD based PSC. The 
authors also suggested that the PSC performance may be improved by changing the work function of graphene and proposed doping as 
an approach to modify the work function of the graphene. Cao et al. [24] introduced functionalized nano-graphene (perthiolated-
trisulfur-annulated hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene,TSHBC) as HTL in PSC which accelerated the hole transportation rate. The authors 
obtained an efficiency of 12.81% with the device structure of FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/TSHBC/Au. They also suggested that graphene 
has better stability as compared to spiro-OMeTAD and the device fabrication can be finished with 45% humidity in air, while this 
condition is not suitable for spiro-OMeTAD. The hole-transportation can be improved by introducing extra graphene into TSHBC and 
the PSC reached an efficiency of 14%. Yan et al. [25] reported that the hole extraction rate for multilayer and single layer graphene is 
5.1 and 3.7 ns(cid:0) 1, respectively and obtained an efficiency of 11.5% with multilayer graphene. According to the findings of the authors, a 
Schottky barrier is formed at the perovskite/graphene interface and an increase in the hole transportation and extraction rate is 
achieved by decreasing the recombination rate as well as blocking the electrons. 
Moreover, graphene has been used as an additive in ZnO and TiO2 based ETLs, and showed an increase in efficiency [26,27]. Wang 
et al. [27] further compared different PSC structures with TiO2 ETL, graphene only ETL, without ETL and high temperature sintered 
TiO2  ETL. They found that the highest efficiency was achieved for the cell with TiO2  þ graphene as an ETL, but nonetheless, 
graphene-based PSC showed better results when compared to the cell without an ETL. This demonstrates that graphene is a suitable 
ETL for PSCs, and the PCE and life time of solar cell devices could thus be increased using graphene as a buffer layer. 
The PSCs using p-Si as an inorganic HTL have been previously modelled [28], and it has been further indicated that p-Si has good 
chemical stability, low cost and higher hole mobility [29]. Yan et al. [30] also studied a low-cost Si-nanowire/perovskite hybrid solar 
cell and obtained a PCE of 13.3%.Therefore, PSCs with n-cSi (crystalline silicon) layer may also be modelled to investigate its role as an 
efficient ETL. 
Having the above observations in mind, the PSCs performance can be upgraded by inserting the perovskite layer in between the 
graphene and Si layers. In the present work, we designed the following configuration p-graphene/CH3NH3PbI3/n-cSi for hybrid solar 
cell using AFORS-HET (Automat for Simulation of Heterostructures) software [31–33]. We optimized each layer and obtained the 
parameters for highest efficiency. The impact of operating temperature and textured front surface on the performance of the solar cell 
is also examined. Our findings indicate that p-graphene and n-cSi can act as an efficient HTL and ETL, respectively, in PSC and 
promising hybrid solar cells may be achieved with superior performance. 
To realize the idea related to the usage of graphene as HTL material, we used a theoretical approach to study hybrid PSCs with 
silicon layer. We designed a p-i-n based structure as p-graphene/CH3NH3PbI3/n-cSi, with ITO (indium tin oxide) and Ag (silver) as the 
front and back contacts in AFORS-HET software. AFORS-HET uses the one-dimensional semiconductor equations related to Shockley 
Reed Hall statistics solver and Lambert-Beer law for optical parameters of different photovoltaic devices. The complete PSC config-
uration is ITO (80 nm)/p-graphene (0.334–6.68 nm)/CH3NH3PbI3 (50–1000 nm)/n-cSi (50–300 μm)/Ag (0.001 cm) as shown in 
Fig. 1. Here, the light enters through the graphene layer and generates electron-hole pairs in the active layer. The generated electrons/ 
holes are collected and transferred by n-cSi and p-graphene to the respective electrodes. We optimized various parameters such as layer 
thickness, electron affinity (χ), energy band gap (Eg), dielectric constant (dk), doping concentrations (ND/NA), effective conduction/

PSC. The simulation parameters used in the software are taken from different experimental and theoretical reports [34–40]. 
To increase the efficiency of solar cells, the front contact surface can be made textured. This textured surface reduces light 
reflection; assists in light trapping and consequently may increase the overall device efficiency due to increase in current. In this work, 
both non-textured and textured front contacts have been applied to model the solar cell performance.

The graphene can be made p-type material by doping with trivalent atoms like boron with the help of different techniques such as 
thermal annealing, ball milling, liquid, solid and gaseous phase chemical doping, and in-situ doping during chemical vapour depo-
sition (CVD) [41,42]. The heteroatom doping onto a graphene sheet can influence the chemical, physical, electronic and photonic 
properties of the material. The solar cell parameter optimization was started by varying the parameters of p-graphene layer first, and 
taking some initial values of the perovskite and n-cSi layers. The values of perovskite layer parameters were fixed at NA ¼ 3 � 1014 
cm(cid:0) 3, NC/NV ¼ 2.5 � 1020 cm(cid:0) 3, Eg ¼ 1.5 eV, χ ¼ 3.9 eV, dk ¼ 30 and thickness ¼ 50 nm. The n-cSi parameters used were ND ¼ 1 �
1016 cm(cid:0) 3, NC/NV ¼ 3 � 1019 cm(cid:0) 3, Eg ¼ 1.12 eV, χ ¼ 4.05 eV, dk ¼ 11.9 and thickness ¼ 100 μm. The p-graphene layer parameters 
kept at constant values were NC/NV ¼ 3 � 1018 cm(cid:0) 3, Eg ¼ 0.5 eV, χ ¼ 5.0 eV, dk ¼ 11 and thickness 0.334 nm. We varied the acceptor 
concentration (NA) of the p-graphene layer from 1 � 1014 to 1 � 1018 cm(cid:0) 3 and observed its effect on PSC parameters. The variation of 
solar cell parameters with NA is mentioned in Fig. 2(a). From the figure, it is observed that as NA increases from 1 � 1014 to 1 �
1018cm(cid:0) 3, the Jsc varies from 24.72 mA/cm2 to 24.90 mA/cm2,Voc remains constant, PCE changes from 12.11% to 12.21%, and FF 
varies from 82.46% to 82.50%. As we increase the acceptor concentration in graphene sheet, the graphene work function is lowered, 
and the conductivity rises. This leads to an increase in Jsc, PCE and FF, but the Voc does not change. Next, the parameters NC and NV are 
changed from 3 � 1018 to 3 � 1021 cm(cid:0) 3 for the monolayer graphene and the simulated results are given in Fig. 2(b). Again, the Voc 
remained constant, but Jsc reduced from 24.90 mA/cm2 to 24.77 mA/cm2, FF slightly changes from 82.50% to 81.49% and the overall 
efficiency also changed from 12.21% to 12.14% with increase in NC/NV value. The minority charge carrier density decreases as NC/NV 
is increased because of trapping of free carrier charges and small life time of photo induced carriers. The Voc reduces from 594.50 mV to 
594.40 mV beyond ~5 � 1020 cm(cid:0) 3 as such high values of NC/NV reduces the barrier height and the built-in voltage [43]. Thus, 
reducing NC/NV below 1019 cm(cid:0) 3 gives high overall PCE. In both the cases of varying NA and NC/NV, it is found that significant changes 
in the solar cell parameters are not observed in the range under study. This implies that the acceptor concentration and the band 
densities do not affect the charge transport to a great extent in this case. 
The dielectric constant (dk) of p-graphene layer was varied keeping other parameters constant as given in Fig. 2(c). The dk value for 
single layer graphene is reported in between 4 and 11 [44]. The maximum value of all the solar cell parameters is obtained at dk ¼ 11 
and the maximum values of Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE are 594.50 mV, 24.90 mA/cm2, 82.50% and 12.21% respectively. The electron affinity 
values of p-graphene vary in the range 4.7–5 eV. The observations presented in Fig. 2(d) reveal that the PCE of the simulated cell is 
increased from 12.03% to 12.21%, being maximum at 5 eV, because on increasing the electron affinity, the barrier height is increased 
which impedes the flow of electrons towards ITO leading to lesser recombination and results in rising Jsc from 24.56 mA/cm2to 24.90 
mA/cm2. Thus, high electron affinity is useful for increasing the device efficiency. This is also in agreement with other reports where 
high electron affinity materials are shown to be preferable for HTL [45]. The change in the overall efficiency is low with change in 
electron affinity because even with the starting value of χ ¼ 4.7, the barrier height between the HTL/perovskite interface is appropriate 
for hole extraction. 
Some studies [34,43] showed that graphene has a band gap that varies from 0 to 0.25 eV, whereas, Nevis et al. [35] have reported 
that graphene has a band gap of 0.5 eV. In view of these studies, we varied the energy gap of graphene from 0 to 0.5 eV as depicted in 
Fig. 2(e). The PCE increases from 11.11% to 12.21%, Jsc changes from 24.18 mA/cm2 to 24.90 mA/cm2 and Voc rises from 564.70 mV 
to 594.50 mV with increase in the energy band gap of graphene. The band gap of graphene affects the built-in potential which may 
have caused the observed increase in Voc. Only a small change in Jsc is observed since it is governed by the production of photocurrent 
in the active layer and not the band gap of the HTL. Moreover, a greater barrier at the interface between HTL and perovskite layer 
sufficiently separates the electron hole pair aiding in an increase in current. Consequently, the FF and PCE increases primarily due to 
increase in Voc, but tends to saturate fast at high band gap. 
The impact of number of graphene layers on solar cell performance is also investigated. The number of graphene layers directly 
influences the sheet resistance as well as the optical transparency. The sheet resistance and optical transparency is reduced with in-
crease in the graphene layers. To prove this concept, the number of graphene layers is varied up to 20 layers. The highest efficiency 
12.21% is obtained for single layer graphene having thickness of 0.334 nm. As we increase the number of graphene layers the

Gagandeep et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Fig. 
efficiency decreases to 10.01%, while FF varies from 82.50% to 82.33%. The Voc and Jsc also decrease from 594.50 mV to 589.60 mV 
and 24.90 mA/cm2to 20.63 mA/cm2, respectively, with the number of layers or increase in thickness of graphene layer. The parameter 
variations are shown in Fig. 2(f). The decrease in performance may be attributed to lesser light reaching the active layer lowering the 
photocurrent. The monolayer graphene shows an optical transparency of 97.7% which is further reduced with increase in graphene 
layers [46]. An addition of each layer reduces the transparency by 2.3%. 
After optimization of graphene parameters, we were able to achieve the best-suited properties of graphene layer that can be 
employed as a HTL in PSC. The optimized parameters are tabulated in Table 1. The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics and the 
quantum efficiency (QE) variation versus wavelength for optimized p-graphene layer are plotted in Fig. 3(a) and (b) respectively. The 
figures depict the J-V characteristics and QE of the cell using optimized value of p-graphene parameter only and with the initial values 
mentioned above for perovskite and n-cSi layers. For the simulated structure, quantum efficiency has been calculated in the range of 
300–1200 nm under the illumination condition of 1 � 1016 cm(cid:0) 2s(cid:0) 1 monochromatic intensity and 10 nm spectral widths. Here the 
external quantum efficiency (EQE) and internal quantum efficiency (IQE and IQE1) of the optimized cell have been given in Fig. 3(b). 
The EQE gives the ratio of the charge carriers collected by the solar cell to the total number of incident photons by the external source, 
regardless of whether the photons are absorbed, reflected or transmitted. On the other hand, the IQE considers only the photons 
absorbed by the solar cell but does not consider whether these absorbed photons contribute to the current or not. Thirdly, IQE1 further 
corrects the IQE by subtracting those photons which may be absorbed by the layers other than the active layer, i.e., the contact layers, 
and thereby, not contributing to the current. Due to this, the EQE is always less than the IQE and IQE1 as observed in Fig. 3(b) as well. 
The IQE and EQE of the cell increase and reach a maximum value, and thereafter decrease with wavelength [39]. It may be 
interpreted from Fig. 3(b) that the IQE1 becomes almost unity in the wavelength range of 300–700 nm indicating that the photons 
absorbed by the perovskite layer contributes sufficiently to the output current. The IQE decreases for the whole wavelength range and 
is approximately 80% in the 400–800 nm range, implying significant absorption by the layers other than the perovskite layer. Further 
reduction in the quantum efficiency is found in EQE, suggesting a loss of incident photons. Thus, this points towards the need of device 
engineering so that improvement in the absorption of incident photons can be achieved by reducing the reflection losses.

After optimizing the p-graphene layer parameters, we optimized the perovskite layer parameters by using the values of p-graphene 
parameters as mentioned in Table 1 and keeping the n-cSi parameter values as given in section 3.1. The properties of the perovskite 
layer have been modified in order to obtain the largest PCE for this configuration. The dielectric constant (dk) of the active layer 
depicts the nature of Columbian forces among the electron-hole pairs and other charges in the material. The behaviour of solar cell 
characteristics with dk is shown in Fig. 4(a). From the figure it can be seen that the PCE of the device varies from 12.27% to 12.21% 
with dk varying from 6.5 to 30 [47,48]. The FF of the device remains constant with value 82.51%, for dk 6.5–25, and after this FF falls 
up to the value 82.50% for dk from 25 to 30. The open circuit voltage (Voc) of the device remains constant with value 594.50 mV and Jsc 
varies from 25.01 mA/cm2 to 24.90 mA/cm2 under the dk variation from 6.5 to 30. The optimized value of dk ¼ 6.5 is taken for further 
calculations. 
After optimizing the dk, we varied the NC/NV within the range of 2.5 � 1018 to 2.5 � 1020 cm(cid:0) 3. As we increase NC/NV the minority 
charge carrier density decreases. Consequently, Voc was constant at value 594.70 mV, fill factor varied from 82.27% to 82.49% and Jsc 
varied from 24.99 mA/cm2 to 25.01 mA/cm2 while the efficiency changed slightly from 12.23% to 12.27% (Fig. 4(b)). Further, the NA/ 
ND is changed in the range 1 � 1013 to 1 � 1017 cm(cid:0) 3, and the simulated values in Fig. 4(c) illustrate that the defect states exist in the 
perovskite layer resulting a noticeable change in Jsc and efficiency value change from 12.27% to 12.01%. 
The thickness of the absorbing layer plays a very important role in the working of the device. Keeping the optimized values of 
above-mentioned parameters for the absorbing layer, we varied the thickness of the active layer in the range 50–1000 nm [39]. With

the increase in absorber thickness, the absorption of light in the layer also increases. The variation in PCE, FF, Jsc and Voc with absorber 
layer thickness is shown in Fig. 4(d). The PCE and Jsc  decreases from 12.27% to 9.11% and 25.01 mA/cm2  to 18.57 mA/cm2 
respectively with thickness because a thicker layer may result into increased recombination and lower charge collection efficiency. 
Hence, using an optimum thickness would ensure a maximum current output from the device. The value of active layer thickness is 
taken around 50 nm in this case. After optimizing the thickness of the active layer, we varied the charge carrier mobility (μe/μh) in the 
range of 10(cid:0) 3 cm2/V.s to 50 cm2/V.s [49] and noted its effect on the performance of the cell. From Fig. 4(e) it is observed that all the

parameters i.e., Jsc, FF and efficiency increase significantly up to 10 cm2/V.s from the initial 13 mA/cm2 to 25.01 mA/cm2, 18.79%– 
82.48% and 1.68%–12.27% respectively, except Voc with mobility and become almost constant up to 50 cm2/V.s. This may be due to 
the decrease in recombination of charge carriers as a result of increase in mobility. The optimized parameters for the perovskite layer 
are summarized in Table 1. Thus, it may be stated that the thickness and mobility values of the perovskite layer dominantly affect the 
performance of the solar cell. On the other hand, the parameters like dielectric constant, NC/NV, NA/ND only slightly improve the 
performance of the solar cell. This may be because at the initial value of the perovskite thickness taken as 50 nm, the charge transport is

adequate due to the long diffusion length of the perovskite material and the suitable built-in voltage at the HTL/perovskite interfaces, 
saturating the efficiency of the solar cell without much change in the parameter range under study. The solar cell J-V characteristics as 
well as quantum efficiency variation with wavelength for optimized parameters are plotted in Fig. 5(a) and (b). The behaviour of the 
cell is shown for the optimized value of perovskite layer and p-graphene parameters mentioned in Table 1, while the parameters for 
n-cSi mentioned in section 3.1 were used.

For obtaining the best possible structure, layer parameters were optimized by considering the parameters of p-graphene and 
perovskite layers mentioned in Table 1. As, the donor concentration (ND) in n-cSi is increased from 1 � 1014 to 1 � 1017 cm(cid:0) 3, the work 
function of the ETL is increased, which results to an increase in Voc. Thus, the values of the performance parameters of the device 
increased with increase in ND and the results are shown in Fig. 6(a). Keeping ND ¼ 1 � 1017 cm(cid:0) 3, the value of NC/NV was changed from 
of 3 � 1019 to 3 � 1021 cm(cid:0) 3 and the variation in the device performance is depicted in Fig. 6(b). From the graph it is seen that the Voc 
significantly reduces from 655.70 mV to 419 mV, while Jsc decreased slightly from 26.63 mA/cm2 to 26.53 mA/cm2 with the variation 
in NC/NV. The efficiency is reduced to 6.89%. Then taking the values of NC/NV ¼ 3 � 1019 cm(cid:0) 3 and ND ¼ 1 � 1017 cm(cid:0) 3, we varied the 
electron affinity (χ) from 3.8 eV to 4.4 eV. In this range Voc was found to change from 676.80 mV to 655.70 mV but Jsc decreased, FF 
and PCE of the cell increased initially and then remained constant as can be seen from Fig. 6(c). At χ ¼ 4.2 eV, the highest value of PCE 
was attained and have a value 14.62%. Next, the thickness of the n-cSi layer was varied from 50 μm to 300 μm and the changes are 
depicted in Fig. 6(d). The highest PCE is found to be 16.75% at a thickness of 300 μm. The simulation parameters are mentioned in 
Table 1. The J-V characteristics and the QE for optimized thickness of n-cSi are plotted in Fig. 7(a and b) and confirm the PCE of 
16.75% for this configuration.

The different layer parameters in heterojunction solar cell have been optimized to obtain the best possible efficiency of the device. 
To further understand the working of the device, the influence of operating temperature needs to be analysed. In the present study, we 
vary the temperature from 300 K to 550 K. The temperature change is taken as an external parameter in the simulation. As the 
temperature increases across the device, the energy band gap of the layer and carrier mobility across the layer interface is affected. The 
carrier recombination increases with the rise in temperature. The degradation in the values of performance parameters has also been 
previously attributed to the deformation and stress enhancement in device under the influence of temperature. These effects cause poor 
interconnectivity between the layers and create more interfacial defects. A high recombination rate prevails resulting into an increase 
in the series resistance and reduction in carrier diffusion length [50]. This is confirmed by our modelling results as depicted in Fig. 8. 
The highest PCE is obtained at 300 K and has a value of 16.75%. 
3.
The working of a device is also influenced by the nature of front contact surface i.e. whether the front contact is plane or textured. 
When the light falls on the front contact having textured surface with pyramidal topology, its angle of incidence with reference to the 
inclined surfaces of the pyramids is changed. The front textured surface not only reduces the reflection, but also in effect increases the 
optical path length as well as the optical thickness of the absorber. We simulated the PSC structure with and without textured front 
surface. The variations in solar cell parameters with the angle of inclination of the pyramidal texture, hence forth referred to as the 
angle of texture, are presented in Fig. 9. The PCE with textured surface is 17.90% as compared to 16.75% without textured surface. 
Here, we varied the angle of texture from 0� to 80�. The value of Jsc is increased from 28.97 mA/cm2 to 30.87 mA/cm2. This variation 
in Jsc is related to the optical confinement of the incident light due to multiple reflections; the short circuit current density being 
proportional to incident light. The value of Voc increases from 686.3 mV to 687.9 mV with the angle of texture varying from 0� to 80�. 
The FF of the device also varies from 84.22% to 84.31%. This behaviour is due to the increased optical confinement with increase in the 
angle of textured surface. 
The PCE of 17.90% for textured front surface is in good agreement with the other graphene based experimental studies [51] and 
also enhanced as compared to other Si/perovskite hybrid solar cell [30]. 
In the present study, we used p-graphene and n-cSi as a hole transporting material and electron transporting material respectively 
in the perovskite solar cell and simulated the structure using AFORS-HET software. We noticed the effect of different layers on the 
working of the device. The power conversion efficiency 16.75% is obtained for optimized structure. We studied the effect of operating 
temperature as well as textured surface of front contact on the device performance. The device parameters decrease with the rise in 
temperature. The efficiency for textured front surface is 17.90% as compared to 16.75% for plane front surface. This theoretical study 
shows that p-graphene and n-cSi can be used as an efficient HTL and ETL respectively in hybrid perovskite solar cell.
