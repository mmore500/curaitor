In  the  presented  work,  cell’s  parameter  of  heterostructure  silicon  solar  cell  modelled  as:  ITO  (front 
contact)/n-Dn/p-cSi/Ag under the illumination of monochromatic light at standard spectrum AM-1.5 G, 
has been optimized by using AFORS-HET v 2.5 software. We have used n-type diamane as an emitter 
layer and the nature of diamane has been considered 3D in spite of 2D as well as electronic nature of 
diamane is considered isotropic. To ensure that Schottky junction has been formed at interface, the elec- 
tric contacts have been made along the c-axis so that maximum charge carriers get collected. To obtain 
the high eﬃciency, various parameters of n-type diamane as well as p-type c-Si layers have been opti- 
mized and the maximum eﬃciency of 16.84% has been obtained for single layer n-diamane at 100 μm 
thick silicon wafer. We also investigated the spectral response and dependency of temperature on the 
performance of exclusively designed solar cell and we obtained the best eﬃciency 16.84% at 300 K tem- 
perature. In order to check the performance on commercially available silicon we have optimized the 
same solar cell by considering the parameters of commercially available p-type crystalline silicon layer 
and maximum eﬃciency 10.41% was achieved. After getting the maximum eﬃciency 16.84% we further 
carried out the simulation by optimizing the layer numbers of n-diamane and found decrement in the 
eﬃciency up to 15.3% which indicates that, eﬃciency slightly decreases as layer number increases. We 
have demonstrated that n-type diamane might be used as an effective emitter layer in crystalline Si het- 
erojunction solar cell. 
Recently, a new allotrope of the carbon named as “Diamane”
3  carbon  bonding  has  been  synthesized  and  re- 
(Dn)  possess  sp 
ported to be two-dimensional (2D) being a physical analogue to 
“graphene-graphane” [1–4] . Recently, Bakharev et al. [5] conﬁrmed 
that  diamane  exhibited  2  D  electronic  system.  It  was  conﬁrmed 
by estimating the optical band gap of diamane adopting the ap- 
proach described in previous studies [ 6 , 7 ] for 2D electronic sys- 
tems. They found that the experimental optical gap value of 3.3–
3.4 eV is consistent with the calculated optical gap of 2.87 eV ob- 
tained for F-diamane. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy was used 
to conﬁrm the successful synthesis of 2D diamane and the char- 
acterization of its electronic structure has also been reported [ 8 , 9 ]. 
It has thermal conductivity of 1960 W/mK as high as to its bulk 
counterpart diamond (10 0 0 W/mK), due to which it is considered 
as promising material for the high temperature electronic applica-

tions [ 1 , 10 ]. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calcula- 
tions reveal that 2D diamane has smaller effective mass (0.55m 0 
) 
of conduction electrons in comparison of its bulk counterpart i.e., 
diamond (0.57m 0 
), which is also very promising to use 2D diamane 
in various electronic applications such as solar cells [1] . 2D mate- 
rials are best to use in electronic applications as they have large 
tunability in their bandgaps and they are ﬂexible, strong and ex- 
tremely  thin.  It  was  ﬁrst  predicted  by  Chernozatonskii  et  al.,  in 
2009  [11] ,  although  its  experimental  synthesis  was  reported  re- 
cently. The detailed veriﬁcation of its bonding and electronic struc- 
ture has also been probed by using various characterization tech- 
niques  like:  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS),  UV  photo- 
electron, Raman, UV–Vis and electron energy loss spectroscopies, 
transmission electron microscopy and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) [5] . 
Formerly,  the  instability  of  diamane  was  marked  as  a  big  hur- 
dle  for  its  above-mentioned  potential  applications.  Recently,  the 
stability of diamane has been improved by the substitution of N 
atoms on its surface. The N atom has one more electron than C 
atom that form lone pair of electrons and behaves as the passi- 
vation,  which  stabilizes  the  structure  and  extends  the  band  gap 
[2] . The ﬁrst principal method has investigated the conﬁguration

stability  and  electronic  properties  of  N-doped  diamane  [2] .  This 
novel 2D material has direct band gaps which can be controlled 
in the range from 0.86 to 5.68 eV [4] . Furthermore, due to its large 
bandgap, the intrinsic carrier concentration stays low even at the 
high temperature. Furthermore, the substitution of N atoms makes 
these ﬁlms highly n-type, and it is found that N-substituted dia- 
manes are harder than fully hydrogenated diamanes [2] . Atomistic 
simulation demonstrated that diamane carries giant in plane stiff- 
ness (715 N/m) as compare of graphene (238 N/m) and graphane 
(449 N/m) [ 1 , 11 ]. It is noteworthy to mentioned that diamane pos- 
2 /Vs)  and  for 
sess  high  carriers’  mobility,  for  electrons  (2732  cm 
2 /Vs) in case of ﬂuorinated and hydrogenated dia- 
holes (1565 cm 
mane, which is superior over those of 
 semiconductor com- 
pounds [12] and reported in 2 D materials. The calculated band 
gap for ﬂuorinated diamane (C 4 
F) (2.93 eV) conﬁrms its high trans- 
parency  [13] .  It  has  to  be  noticed  that  the  work  function  of  2D 
diamane  can  also  be  turned  in  the  range  of  7.24  eV  to  0.62  eV 
after  vacuum  annealing  at  700  °C  and  the  work  function  of  as- 
grown  bilayer  graphene  was  reported  to  be  4.4  eV  [ 14 , 5 ]  which 
also  opens  up  its  use  in  various  electronic  applications.  Above- 
mentioned unique properties of ultrathin 2D diamane ﬁlm moti- 
vate us to explore the potential application of n-type diamane as 
an effective emitter layer in Si-based heterojunction photovoltaic 
cells. The role of emitter layer in the crystalline silicon heterojunc- 
tion solar cell is not only to allow the maximum photons to sur- 
pass across the interface but also to develop a built-in potential at 
diamane/silicon interface which require to discrete the photogen- 
erated charge carriers. In recent time, diamane is expected to be 
used in various areas such as nano-optics, nano-electronics, nano- 
electromechanical  systems,  mechanical  resonators  and  electronic 
devices at high temperature [5] . In spite of that, the application 
of diamane in the solar cell has not been much investigated yet. 
This also inspired us to use n-type diamane as an emitter layer 
in the silicon heterojunction solar cell. As diamane layer number 
increases from one to ﬁve, there was a small decrement in the ef- 
ﬁciency from 8 to 7.53%. Since, this small eﬃciency was not wor- 
thy to obtain an eﬃcient solar cell therefore, it had become more 
necessary to optimize the values of parameters of p-cSi as well so 
that an affordable solar cell with less manufacturing cost can be 
cell modeled as ITO (front contact)/n-Dn/p-cSi/Ag was optimized 
under the illumination of monochromatic light with a power den- 
2  and spectral width of  10 nm by  using latest 
sity  of 100 W/cm 
version  2.5  of  the  software  AFORS-HET.  This  software  generally 
solves the 1-D semiconductor equations such as continuity equa- 
tion, transport and Poisson’s equation for both holes and electrons 
by using ﬁnite difference at different conditions. In this simulated 
cell, the n-diamane has been chosen as an emitter layer or con- 
ducting electrode while, the p-cSi as an absorbing layer. The vari- 
ables of both n-diamane and p-cSi layer were optimized to achieve 
the notable eﬃciency for n-diamane/p-cSi solar cell. The simula- 
tion was performed by considering the isotropic elastic nature of 
diamane layer. Since, diamane is isotropic in nature therefore the 
eﬃciency will remain same for both armchair and zig-zag direc- 
tion in diamane layer. The purpose of this simulation is to analysis 
the impact of isotropic nature of diamane and silicon wafer on the 
functioning of solar cell and to enlighten the cell response. 
The  proposed  structure  of  solar  cell  is  shown  in  Fig.  (1) . 
To  design  this  structure,  we  have  used  current  version  2.5  of 
AFORS-HET (Automat FOR Simulation of Heterojunction) software 
which  uses  Shockley-Read-Hall  recombination  statistics  for  dif- 
ferent  layers  of  solar  cell  [15] .  In  the  proposed  structure  of  so- 
lar cell, ITO(TCO)/n-diamane/p-crystalline Silicon/Ag (back contact)

displayed in Fig. (1) . We have taken ITO as transparent conduct- 
ing oxide (TCO) as well as anti-reﬂector to ensure that maximum 
number of photons get transmit. So, as the light incident on the 
cell photons get absorb in the absorber layer, as photon absorp- 
tion  increased  in  the  active  layer  more  electron  and  hole  pairs 
will be generated. In this way, to achieve the maximum electron- 
hole pairs generation in the absorber layer we intend to use the 
material of highest transmission eﬃciency and to fulﬁll this pur- 
pose we used ITO as TCO. ITO can directly be deposited on dia- 
mane with the help of electron beam and pulsed layer deposition 
(PLD) technique transferred on SiO 2 
/Si pattern substrate [16–19] . 
Microstructure, surface morphology, electrical and optical proper- 
ties of ITO ﬁlm can be characterized and analysed by using various 
techniques like: XRD, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force 
microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy. The 
standard transmission line model (TLM) method was used to eval- 
uate sheet resistance ITO/n-Si contacts in HJ silicon solar cells [20] . 
This  deposition  technique  might  not  be  harmed  the  diamane  as 
well  as  SiO 2 
/Si  substrate.  Ag  was  chosen  as  the  back  contact  as 
shown in Fig. (1) . The [n, k] ﬁle for front contact as well as back 
contact was taken as default which are in-built in the software. 
All  the  details  about  the  parameters  of  front  and  back  contacts 
are tabulated in Table 1 . The proposed structure was illuminated 
under Air Mass 1.5 G, spectral width 10 nm with the power den- 
2  as a light source. Simultaneously, the tem- 
sity of 100 mW/cm 
perature of the cell was maintained at 300 K. Since, we prefer to 
take the reﬂection coeﬃcient of front contact as smaller and the 
reﬂection coeﬃcient of back contact as higher for getting higher 
eﬃciency. The front contact should be transparent ideally, so that 
maximum light can pass through the surface and get collected at 
the  absorbing  layer.  Therefore,  in  this  simulation  we  have  taken 
the reﬂection coeﬃcient of front contact as nearly zero whereas, 
the  reﬂection  coeﬃcient  of  the  back  contact  was  taken  as  0.05. 
The generation of electron-hole pairs was described by Lambert- 
Beer  model  which  is  in-built  in  the  software  and  the  reﬂection 
from  the  diamane/Si  interface  is  not  considered  [15] .  Shockley- 
Read-Hall recombination and/or dangling-bond recombination was 
considered as recombination model within the software including 
some defect states within the bandgap. ITO/n-Dn interface is con- 
sidered as MS-Schottky front interface and the back interface i.e., 
p-cSi/Ag is also considered as MS-Schottky. To interpret the trans- 
portation of charge carriers in diamane layer, drift and diffusion 
model was applied in the software, where the differential transport 
equation for both holes and electrons was taken as 2-D in nature 
with carrier densities in A/cm [15] . At diamane/Si interface, two- 
dimensional equations are coupled with three-dimensional equa- 
tions (as we know diamane is 2D and c-Silicon is 3D in nature) 
to act for the transport and boundary conditions at the interface. 
In this simulation, we have not assumed any mismatching of lat- 
tices between the layers and the movement of minority charge car- 
riers has been considered through the c-axis. Ideally, diamane is 
2-dimensional, only if this fulﬁls the condition

is the carrier density in cm

˜10 
5 cm 
mane is synthesized by chemical exposure of bilayer graphene to 
H or F atoms which results in their attachment to graphene sur- 
face, hence we have taken the value of carrier density reported in 
graphene. By following the condition reported by Sarma et al. [ 22 ], 
–3 in graphene cannot satisfy the above-mentioned 
even n 
condition additionally, it has also been reported that doping in 2D 
materials  increases  the  interlayer  spacing  [ 21 , 23 ].  Therefore,  we 
have considered both graphene as well as diamane as quasi 3D. 
The quantum conﬁnement can be obtained by lowering the thick- 
ness. The thickness of single layer diamane is taken as 0.334 nm 
and the [n, k] ﬁle has been calculated by using the data provided 
in  the  previous  literature  [24] .  The  value  of  refractive  index  (n) 
and extinction coeﬃcient (k) are estimated to be 1.5 and 2.7, re- 
spectively [24] . Because of isotropic nature of diamane, properties 
like mobility and effective mass of charge carriers are same in both 
armchair and zigzag directions. 
For  optimizing  the  cell  parameters  and  to  simulate  the  cell, 
the bulk and interfacial defect distribution as well as recombina- 
tion rate (G) were taken constant in the software. Moreover, the 
model chosen for ITO/n-diamane and p-crystalline Si/Ag interface 
was MS-Schottky model and the model chosen for n-diamane/p- 
cSi interface is drift-diffusion, respectively. The parameters which 
have to be optimized are: N D 
(effec- 
tive conduction and valance band density), energy bandgap ( E g ), 
χ (aﬃnity), 
ε
 r  (dielectric constant), layer thickness, electron and 
hole mobilities (μn , μh 
). The optimization of above-mentioned pa- 
rameters for diamane was carried out by taking the set values of 
parameters of p-cSi layer in the range of reported values in the lit-

(conduction  band  and  valance  band  density), 
diamane’s parameters, we have further optimized the various pa- 
(acceptor concentration), 
rameters of p-type c-Si wafer such as: N A 
χ (aﬃnity), 
N C 
and wafer thickness by keeping the parameters of n-Dn at their 
best optimized values. The range of parameters of n-diamane have 
been taken from the available literatures [ 4 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 21 , 26 ] and the 
range of parameters of p-cSi which we have considered here are 
for (100) oriented single crystalline Si [26–29] tabulated in Table 2 . 
The schematic of energy band diagram for the proposed struc- 
ture ITO (TCO)/n-Dn/p-cSi/Ag has been depicted in Fig. 1 (b). Since, 
drift-diffusion  effect  is  considered  at  the  interface  therefore,  the 
majority of charge carriers i.e., electrons from the n-diamane and 
holes from the p-cSi are diffused towards each other until thermal 
equilibrium is developed. This happens because of concentration 
gradient at the interface, this phenomenon is called diffusion pro- 
cess. An electric ﬁeld exists in the depletion region which spread 
up to some width called depletion width W, in both p and n re- 
gions. Both electrons and holes in this depletion region are car- 
ried away by this electric ﬁeld. As a result, a drift current devel-

ops which balances the diffusion current and appears due to the 
difference in electron and hole densities at the junction. As a re- 
sult, thermal equilibrium is established and the energy bands start 
bending near the Fermi level. The built-in potential (e V bi 
) is the 
reason for charge segregation across the junction in the solar cell 
as discussed above. This built-in potential (e V bi 
) in both p-cSi and 
n-diamane can be framed in the form of work-function according 
to the equations written as follows:

As  n-diamane/p-crystalline  Si  junction  is  illuminated,  it  gives 
rise  to  electron-hole  pairs  (EHP)  which  gets  separated  because 
of  the  built-in  potential.  The  minority  charge  carriers  ﬂow  to- 
wards  the  n-diamane  and  p-crystalline  Si  respectively,  depicted 
in  Fig.  1 (b).  When  open  circuit  condition  is  applied,  the  photo- 
generated  charge  carriers  intensify  the  carrier  density  in  their 
corresponding ﬁelds and because of this intensiﬁcation of charge 
carriers, quasi-Fermi level approaches the conduction band in n- 
diamane and valance band in p-cSi as a result V OC 
develops. In the 
same manner under short-circuit condition, these photo-generated 
charge carriers do not intensify because of the collection of charge 
carriers at their respective electrodes which results in the J SC 
that 
ﬂows in the outer circuit.

here,  e  is  the  electronic  charge  and  m 
is  the  effective  mass  of

relation given by 
T  [ 25 , 26 ] and indicates that as mobil- 
ity decreases diffusion constant also decreases as it is directly pro- 
portional  to  the  mobility  of  charge  carriers  and  therefore,  diffu-

distance an electron can move and recombine, it depends on the 
recombination time as well as diffusion constant. In this manner,

After  optimizing  N D 
,  the  next  parameter  bandgap 
( E g )  is  optimized  in  the  range  of  0.86  to  5.6  eV.  Here,  we  have 
chosen a higher range of bandgap for the simulation by keeping in 
mind that if the UV light present in solar light could contribute to 
the higher bandgap. We have taken this range of bandgap in or- 
der to see the effect of bandgap on the solar cell’s eﬃciency for 
all derivatives of diamane as it has various derivatives which pos- 
sesses a range of bandgap depending on the functional group they 
contain  and  many  other  factors  too.  But  we  did  not  notice  any 
change in the eﬃciency of solar cell after the bandgap 1.3 eV. It 
is reported that dielectric constant is inversely proportional to the 
bandgap energy therefore, on changing the bandgap value dielec- 
tric constant also changes. For higher bandgap dielectric constant 
becomes smaller which consequently increases the recombination 
loses due to the improvement in the exciton binding energy. There- 
fore, on further increasing the bandgap there will not be seen any 
improvement in the value of eﬃciency of the solar cell and it be- 
came constant 7.74% after the bandgap 1.3 eV. In this speciﬁc sec-

tion of manuscript, we discussed only about the effect of varying 
the bandgap because we exclusively want to see the effect of vary- 
ing bandgap on the performance of solar cell. Therefore, we did not 
discuss about the variation in the dielectric constant here. We have 
discussed about the effect of varying the dielectric constant on the 
performance of solar cell in another section of the manuscript. As

is the best optimized bandgap for single layer n-diamane. 
The optimized results of the electron aﬃnity (

in Fig. 2 (g). The reason behind this small linear increment in the

tivity ( 
 r ) in the range from 4 to 11 and the performance of pro- 
posed solar cell are depicted in Fig. 2 (i and j). From Fig. 2 (i and 
j), it is noticed that as the dielectric constant increased from 4 to 5 
then may be due to the reduction in the excitation binding energy 
the recombination losses decreased and therefore the eﬃciency in- 
creased by a small value from 8.006% to 8.007%. But on further 
increasing the value of dielectric constant the eﬃciency falls off
from 8.007% to 8.006% rather than increasing, as we know higher 
dielectric constant reduces the exciton binding energy which con- 
sequently results in decreased recombination losses. This may be 
have  happened  because  it  is  reported  that V bi 
[ 25 , 26 , 34 ]. 
Therefore,  an  increment  in  the  value  of  dielectric  constant  de- 
teriorates V bi 
which consequently decrease the eﬃciency [26] . In 
this manner, these two effects balance each other and no further 
η has been observed. In this 
change in the values of V OC , J SC , FF and 
way, the maximum eﬃciency 8.007% was achieved at the value 5

This was happened, because of smaller electron-hole pair genera-

to 74.66% and then decreased inﬁnitesimally on further increasing

the number of layers. Because of lower value of V OC 
also decreased from 7.88% to 7.53%. The best optimized eﬃciency 
8% was achieved for single layer n-diamane. Since, we found dete- 
η on increasing the layer 
rioration in the values of V OC 
numbers  of  n-diamane  we  can  say  that  thickness  of  n-diamane 
does not play an important role in improving the eﬃciency of the 
solar cell and the generation of photo carriers. We also know that 
on  increasing  the  thickness  the  bandgap  decreases  which  in  re- 
sults increases the dielectric constant which consequently decrease 
the recombination losses due to decrease in exciton binding en- 
ergy. Therefore, according to this concept eﬃciency should get in- 
creased on increasing the thickness of n-diamane but this is not 
seen from the results shown in Fig. 2 (k and l). This may have hap- 
pened because of the reduction in transmittance on increasing the 
layer number which compensates the effect of reduced bandgap on 
increasing the dimensionality of carbon material (diamane). From 
Fig. 2 (k and l) it is noticed that on increasing the layer number 
of  diamane  from  1  to  5  the  eﬃciency  changed  slightly  from  8% 
to 7.53%. Therefore, we can say that increased number of layers of 
diamane do not play a signiﬁcant role in enhancing the eﬃciency 
of solar cell. It only provides the required Schottky junction at the 
interface for the current movement and act as an effective emitter 
layer in c-Si heterojunction solar cell. 
3.2. Optimization and simulation of p-crystalline silicon wafer

We further optimized variables of p-crystalline Si wafer while, 
setting the parameters of n-Dn at best optimized values. To carry 
out this simulation, ﬁrst we optimized the acceptor concentration 
of p-cSi wafer. This will intensify the eﬃciency of the ITO (TCO)/n- 
Dn/p-cSi/Ag structured solar cell, the value of N A

results in an increase of work function of p-type Si 
barrier height according to Eq. (2) which will increase both V bi

the range from 3.6 to 4.5 eV. For this aﬃnity, V OC 
was found to 
slightly increased from 699.2 mV to 697.7 mV on increasing aﬃn- 
ity from 3.6 eV to 3.8 eV and then it stayed constant at the value 
697.7 mV on further increase in aﬃnity after 3.8 eV. Whereas, the 
was noticed to decrease straight from 28.95 mA/cm 
value of J SC 
2  as depicted in Fig. 3 (e, f). The value of FF ﬁrst 
to 28.55 mA/cm 
increased from 83.19% to 83.58% on increasing the electron aﬃn- 
ity from 3.6 eV to 4.1 eV but on further crossing of the value of 
electron aﬃnity the FF starts decreasing from 83.58% and reached 
83.21% at  aﬃnity  4.5  eV.  This  reduction in  FF  on  increasing the 
aﬃnity from 4.2 eV to 4.5 eV can be understood by the concept of 
changing the work function of p-cSi at the interface by the rela-

aﬃnity of Si due to which the carrier transportation rate in the p- 
cSi layer would reduce. This reduction will increase the series re- 
sistance of both p-cSi wafer and the cell. Therefore, the FF reduces 
after 
 4.1 eV. The eﬃciency of the optimized cell was found 
to decrease linearly from 16.84% to 16.58% as we increase aﬃnity 
in the range 3.6 to 4.5 eV. In this way the best optimized cell was 
obtained at aﬃnity 3.6 eV.

To further analyze the possibility of cost-effective cell, the next 
variable we optimized is the thickness of p-cSi layer. We have op- 
timized the thickness of p-cSi wafer ranging from 20 to 300 μm. 
From Fig. 3 (g, h), it is clearly visible that for 20 μm thick p-cSi 
layer,  the  eﬃciency  is  15.48%.  Higher  eﬃciency  16.84%  was  ob- 
tained for 100 μm thick silicon layer. This is because as the thick- 
ness increases number of charge carriers increases consequently, 
J SC 
increases.  For  thicker  layer  of  p-cSi,  the  lifespan  of  minority 
charge carriers gets reduced because of its less drift length. Ad- 
ditionally, the excess photogenerated charge carriers and their re- 
combination  rate  have  been  found  in  proportion  in  the  thicker 
, J SC 
,  J SC 
,  FF  and 
28.95 mAcm 
silicon  wafer,  which  overall  results  in  a  constant  value  of  V OC 
–2  after thickness 100 μm. The FF 
699.2 mV and J SC 
and eﬃciency were also constant after getting a value 83.19% and 
16.84% respectively, beyond the thickness 100 μm. Thus, we did not 
η on  further 
notice  any  change  in  the  value  of  V OC 
increasing the thickness of p-cSi layer after 100 μm and we can 
say that, these saturated values of V OC 
and FF have produced 
a maximum eﬃciency of 16.84%, even on increasing the thickness 
of p-cSi wafer up to 300 μm. Another reason for not improving 
the eﬃciency further on increasing the thickness of p-cSi wafer be- 
yond 100 μm is that in a thick layer of p-cSi more dangling bonds 
is found which became the recombination centers for the photo- 
generated charge carriers due to the increased number of defects 
on  the  surface  of  thick  silicon  layer.  That  is  why,  the  decreased 
bandgap on increasing the thickness of layer does not contribute 
in improving the conversion eﬃciency of the solar cell. Therefore, 
large  thickness  of  p-cSi  does  not  ﬁnd  to  play  an  important  role 
in improving the eﬃciency of the cell. From Fig. 3 (g and h) it is 
shown that during the optimization of thickness of p-cSi layer the 
eﬃciency increases from 15.48 to 16.84% only which is not much 
recommendable.

ously reported data [ 26 , 40 , 41 ]. We optimized the thickness of sil- 
icon layer in the range from 20 to 300 μm and the highest eﬃ- 
ciency 10.41% was found for thickness 100 μm as shown in Fig. 3 (k 
and l). Since, front and back contacts play an important role in the 
solar cell as the front contact is required to be highly transparent 
so that maximum photons can reach to the active layer and en- 
hance the conversion eﬃciency. Therefore, we preferred the front 
contact with low reﬂection coeﬃcient or nearly 0. Hence, we have 
given more preference to ITO (Indium Tin Oxide), as TCO (Trans- 
parent Conducting Oxide) in designing of our solar cell to intensify 
the effective illuminating area, because ITO increases the optical 
absorption instead of reﬂection that occurred in other metal con- 
tacts and it possesses low sheet resistance, high mobility and it is 
optically transparent too. Furthermore, in order to check the effect 
of back contact on the solar cell we have changed the back con- 
tacts by Au (where n is taken as 0.27049 and k is taken as 2.7789) 
and Tin (where n is taken as 1.96 and k is equal to 3.06), these 
ﬁles are present already in the AFORS-HET software and we found 
that maximum eﬃciency is achieved in case of Au and Ag because 
of their larger work function. This indicates that both reﬂection co- 
eﬃcient and work function of front as well as back constant play 
signiﬁcant role in the solar cells. Here, we have given more pref- 
erence to ITO (Indium Tin Oxide), as TCO (Transparent Conducting 
Oxide) in designing of our solar cell to intensify the effective il- 
luminating area, because TCO increases the optical absorption in- 
stead of reﬂection that occurred in other metal contacts. 
3.3. Spectral response, quantum eﬃciency and temperature 
dependency 
Generally, spectral response is conceptually similar to the quan- 
tum eﬃciency (QE) of the solar cell . The QE is deﬁned as the ratio 
of the number of electrons collected by the cell as output to the 
number  of  photons  incident  on  its  surface  whereas,  spectral  re-

sponse is deﬁned as the ratio of current generated by the cell to 
the optical power incident on its surface [26] . Quantum eﬃciency 
and spectral response both are used in cell analysis one uses the 
photons ﬂux and the other uses the power of light at each wave- 
length,  respectively.  QE  can  be  converted  into  spectral  response 
=
(SR) by using the formula: SR 
QE. To analysis the spectral re- 
sponse (SR), external quantum eﬃciency (EQE) and internal quan- 
tum eﬃciency (IQE) of the optimized cell at eﬃciencies 8%, 10.41% 
and 16.84% we performed the simulation in the wavelength range 
30 0–120 0 nm and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . We observed 
that, at shorter wavelengths i.e., below 600 nm the diamane layer 
was  found  to  absorb  most  of  the  light,  this  results  in  less  pho- 
tons passing to p-cSi layer subsequently small amount of current 
would generate in the shorter wavelengths and the cell response 
was found to be very low. In the wavelength range from 600 to 
10 0 0 nm most of the photons reach silicon layer where, the en- 
ergy they constitute found equal to the bandgap energy of silicon 
layer and this energy then converted into electrical energy inside 
the  silicon  layer.  Therefore,  the  optimized  cell  achieved  its  ideal 
response at intermediate wavelengths. Since silicon is an indirect 
bandgap semiconductor therefore, there will not be any sharp cut 
=
off at the wavelength corresponding to its bandgap ( E g 
 1.12 eV). 
So, the spectral response falls back to zero at longer wavelengths. 
From Fig. 4 , it is clearly visible that for greater than 100 μm thick 
silicon layer, spectral response maintained its uniformity. This is 
because the effective conversion rate remains constant as we in- 
crease thickness beyond 100 μm. 
The internal and external quantum eﬃciencies (IQE and EQE) of 
the optimized cell at eﬃciencies 8%, 10.41% and 16.84% has been 
observed and the results are being shown in Fig. 4 . Internal quan-

tum eﬃciency do not consider the reﬂection and transmission of 
photon outside the solar cell while, EQE considers the outcomes 
of optical losses i.e., reﬂection and transmission. Fig. 4 (b and c) 
reveals that, at initial wavelength 300 nm EQE and IQE is having 
smaller value this is because of the optical losses at the shorter 
wavelengths.  The  IQE  and  EQE  are  maximum  at  the  wavelength 
400 nm and above 400 nm both eﬃciencies start falling off and 
reaches to zero at 1200 nm. Since, parameter’s optimization of sil- 
icon as well as diamane was unable to nullify the optical losses 
on the surface of the solar cell. Hence, maximum EQE and IQE was 
noticed for the wavelength 400 nm. The higher value of EQE at the 
wavelength 400 nm suggests that as we optimize doping concen- 
tration and effective band density then there would be an incre- 
ment in the electron-hole pair generation rate and subsequently, 
collection of surplus charge carriers due to which highest eﬃciency 
has  been  achieved  at  400  nm.  We  found  that,  IQE  and  EQE  re- 
sponses  of  the  cell  with  eﬃciencies  8%,  10.41%  and  16.84%  are 
almost  same,  which  indicates  the  equal  amount  of  charge  carri- 
ers gathered for this range of wavelengths parallel to the photons 
absorbed by the solar cell. At higher wavelength regions, the re- 
combination rate of the generated charge carriers is better there- 
fore, both internal and external eﬃciencies become negligible at 
1200 nm wavelength.

In order to realize the effect of varying temperature on the op- 
eration of solar cell we have further simulated the best optimized 
cell  comprises  eﬃciency  16.84%  in  the  environment  of  300  to 
400 K temperature and the outputs are depicted in Fig. 5 (a, b). We

Dn/p-cSi/ (back contact) Ag. The independent consequences of op- 
timizing seven parameters of n-type diamane wafer on the opera- 
tion of solar cell were investigated and only single parameter: hole 
mobility  (μp )  was  noticed  to  not  inﬂuence  its  working  whereas, 
other parameters were directly affecting the behavior of proposed 
cell. After optimizing the parameters of diamane as well as sili- 
con, the maximum eﬃciency of 16.84% was achieved and the for- 
mation of Schottky junction at n-Dn/p-cSi interface was found to 
play major role in the processing of the cell as it helps in carry- 
ing current across the junction. This junction is responsible for the 
current movement across n-Dn/p-cSi interface. As the work func- 
tion of diamane can be varied in the range 7.24 eV to 0.62 eV and 
the  work  function  of  p-type  silicon  layer  is  found  in  the  range 
4.9–5.1  eV.  Here,  we  have  taken  the  work  function  of  diamane 
as 4.4 eV smaller than the work-function of p-type silicon which 
supports the formation of Schottky junction at the interface. We 
also compared the optimized values with the reported experimen- 
tal values and found satisfactory results. Higher thickness of both 
diamane as well as silicon were not found to contribute in improv- 
ing the eﬃciency of the solar cell on the large scale. It has been 
found that the thickness of front and back contacts does not play 
an important role on the performance of the modelled heterojunc- 
tion cell. The results of the modelled cell have also not changed 
much  on  changing  the  metal  contacts  at  front  and  back  side  of 
the cell. Finally, it has been concluded that if we could reduce the 
sheet resistance of diamane and can increase its work-function by 
any technique like chemical doping, then few layers n-diamane can 
work more eﬃciently as an emitter layer in Si heterojunction solar 
cell.
