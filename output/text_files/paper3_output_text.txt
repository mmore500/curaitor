All-brominated cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn growing attention owing 
to unprecedented stability in the family of perovskites. It usually employs a two-step method to prepare CsPbBr3 
films owing to the low solubility of CsBr in the common solvents. The researchers have to provide enough Cs 
source through increasing the reaction time or repeat times of CsBr deposition so as to obtain the target CsPbBr3 
films. The long preparation period and tedious process increase the time and economic cost, which may limit the 
practical application of CsPbBr3  solar cells. Herein, a facile method is proposed to prepare CsPbBr3  films, in 
which appropriate CsBr is pre-introduced into PbBr2  solutions in the first step, and CsBr/2-methoxyethanol 
solution (~35 mg mL(cid:0) 1) is used as solution conversion medium in the second step. Benefitting from the pre- 
introduction of CsBr in the first step, a single phase of CsPbBr3 films with full coverage can be conversed for 
only once CsBr supplementation. After integrating the CsPbBr3 films into a solar cell, it delivers a power con-
version efficiency (PCE) of 7.48% basing on the configuration of FTO/TiO2/CsPbBr3/Carbon. This work largely 
shortens the preparation time of CsPbBr3 films, which may provide a practical way for the large-scale production 
of 
All-inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3  attracts more attentions in opto-
electronic devices such as solar cells, photodetectors and light-emitting 
devices, due to its superior optoelectronic properties and high stability 
in air conditions. The highly compatible with the carbon electrode in 
ambient  condition  makes  CsPbBr3  as  a  reasonable  candidate  to  full 
solution-processed  solar  cell  fabrication  [1–4].  The  big  challenge  to 
CsPbBr3  films  for  solar  cells  is  to  fabricate  pure  and  smooth  thick 
perovskite layer due to the poor solubility of CsBr in traditional organic 
solvents. The common way is so-called two-step method, in which PbBr2 
films were firstly prepared, and then exposed to CsBr methanol solution 
for an optimized time, usually at least 10 min, to obtain desired CsPbBr3 
films [1–8]. However, the reaction time is so sensitive that either too 
short or too long reaction time could generate byproducts like CsPb2
and Cs4PbBr6, which limits the photovoltaic performance and lead to 
other side effects [9–11]. 
To exclude the byproducts, Duan et al. [12] proposed a multi-steps 
solution processed technique to prepare high purity CsPbBr3 films. In 
this method, a drop of CsBr/methanol was spin-coated onto the PbBr2 
films, followed by annealing at 250  ◦C for 5 min, then repeated this 
process for several cycles. According to their report, the components, 
crystal structure, and morphology of the as-prepared perovskite films 
are strongly dependent on the preparation cycles. Especially, it needs at 
least four cycles which cost no less than 20 min to obtain pure CsPbBr3 
films  in  their method. Obviously, it  is  a  time-consuming method  to 
prepare pure phase CsPbBr3  films. Meanwhile, the methanol used to 
dissolve CsBr could decompose CsPbBr3  during the treatment, which 
may resulting in poor morphology and more defects in the final products 
[13]. In order to eliminate methanol as the solvent, Feng et al. replaced

6.54%, but they still need to use multi-steps solution processed method 
[15]. Evidently, the poor solubility of CsBr in common solvents lead to 
complicated fabrication processes and long crystallization period. 
By reviewing the previous report, these processes usually separate 
PbBr2 solution with CsBr solution. Whether separating certain amount of 
CsBr into both poor and favourable solvents could reduce the prepara-
tion time needs to be further investigated. In this work, appropriate CsBr 
is introduced into PbBr2/DMSO solution in the first step to prepare Pb- 
rich phase of Cs–Pb–Br films. Then, high quality CsPbBr3 films are ob-
tained by spin-coating a CsBr/2-methoxyethanol (~35 mg mL(cid:0) 1) onto 
the Cs–Pb–Br films for only once. As a consequence, a hole transport 
layer (HTL) free CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cell by using carbon act as the 
electrode shows a PCE of 7.48%, and possesses excellent stability in the 
air atmosphere. This work provides a facile and cost-effective approach 
to prepare CsPbBr3 films, making it a promising application for CsPbBr3 
based devices. 
Device fabrication: Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates 
were cleaned by sonication in deionized water, 2-propanol, ethanol, and 
deionized water successively. The deposition of electron transport layer 
of TiO2 films are achieved according to our previous work [16]. 
The perovskite films  were fabricated by a  two-steps spin-coating 
technology, as shown in Scheme 1. In the first step, the matrices were 
prepared  from  PbBr2/DMSO  solution  (~2.0  M)  with  addition  of 
different molar ratios of CsBr to form perovskite precursor solutions. 
Before the deposition of perovskite films, all precursor solutions were 
filtered using 0.45 μm pore size filter and immediately used. Then, the 
different solutions were spin-coated onto pre-heated substrates 80 ◦C at 
Fig. 1. The photograph of solutions with different molar ration between PbBr2 
and CsBr in DMSO. (a)2:0; (b) 2:0.5; (c) 2:1; (d) 2:1.
the methanol with 2-methoxyethanol for preparing CsBr solution [9]. 
They can obtain single phase CsPbBr3 film in a few minutes. However, 
the morphology of this film is too poor to use in solar cell devices. Sooner 
after, they proposed a binary solvent system of 2-methoxyethanol/iso-
propanol to prepare CsBr solution (~15 mg mL(cid:0) 1), and then simulta-
neously optimized the morphology and phase of the target CsPbBr3 film 
by dipping the PbBr2 into the CsBr/(2-methoxyethanol + isopropanol) 
solution for 40 min, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.29% 
was achieved basing on FTO/TiO2/CsPbBr3/Carbon architecture [14]. 
Recently, Chen et al. also employed 2-methoxyethanol solvent for dis-
solving CsBr to yield high-quality

electrode was deposited by using screen printing of carbon paste with 
drying at 100 ◦C for 10 min. 
Characterization:  The  phase  and  morphology  of  PbBr2  and 
Cs–Pb–Br films were measured by X-ray diffraction (PANalytical X’Pert3 
Powder)  and  field-emission  scanning  electron  microscopy  (NovaTM 
NanoSEM 430), respectively. The UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimazu 
UV-2550) was employed to get the absorption spectra of the PbBr2 and 
Cs–Pb–Br  films.  A  photoluminescence  spectrometer  (Edinburgh  In-
struments, LP 980) was utilized to obtain the photoluminescence (PL) 
spectra. The photovoltaic performance of solar cells was recorded using 
a Keithley 2400 under AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination. The inci-
dent photo-to-current collection efficiency spectrum (IPCE) of solar cells 
were performed an integrated system from Enlitech (QE-R3011). 
We first investigated the solubility of CsBr in PbBr2/DMSO solution. 
As shown in Fig. 1, it is still a clear solution even the concentration of 
CsBr increases from 0 M to 1.0 M in the mixtures (Fig. 1a–c). However, 
the mixture becomes turbid when the concentration of CsBr increases to 
1.5 M (Fig. 1d). In light of the dissolution state, we employ the solutions 
composed of different molar ratios between PbBr2 and CsBr from 2:0, 
2:0.5 and 2:1 to prepare the Cs–Pb–Br matrices in the first step for un-
derstanding the phase composition. 
The  as-prepared  samples  are  examined  by  the  X-ray  diffraction 
(XRD).  Fig.  2a  shows  the  XRD  patterns  of  the  films  prepared  from

for 5 min in a N2-filled glovebox. In the second step, 90 μL CsBr/2- 
methoxyethanol solution (~35 mg mL(cid:0) 1) (see Fig. S1) was dropped 
on the matrices and stay it for 60 s, then the substrates were spin-coated 
at 2000 rpm for 30 s in ambient air atmosphere. The matrices are further 
annealed at 250 ◦C for 5 min to form Cs–Pb–Br films. Finally, the carbon

different solutions. The film prepared from the solution of 2:0 are pure 
PbBr2, which is confirmed by the characteristic peak at 18.5◦ corre-
sponding to the (020) crystal plane [17]. In addition to having PbBr2 in 
the film when 0.5 M CsBr is introduced into the solution, the obvious 
diffraction peaks can be indexed at 15.2◦, 21.6◦, 30.7◦, 34.3◦ and 44.1◦
correspond to the (100), (110), (200), (210) and (220) planes of the 
11.7◦, 23.4◦，29.4◦ and 47.9◦ correspond to the (002), (210), (213) and 
(420) planes of the CsPb2Br5 respectively [18], indicating the coexis-
tence of CsPb2Br5, CsPbBr3 and PbBr2 in the Cs–Pb–Br films. When the 
concentration increased to 1.0 M, the CsPbBr3 component increases in 
accompanied with the decreases of PbBr2 and CsPb2Br5. We also study 
the surface morphology evolution by using scanning electron micro-
scopy (SEM). Fig. 2b shows a SEM image of film prepared by pure PbBr2 
solution. The film exhibits an extremely smooth morphology with dense 
and compact structure, which is not beneficial for the permeation of 
CsBr solution in further step treatment. When including CsBr into the 
solution, the as-prepared films become much rougher with many pores 
and cracks on the surface (Fig. 2c and d). These rough morphologies 
have significant impacts on the permeation of CsBr/2-methoxyethanol 
solution in the second step treatment [19,20]. As shown in the insets 
of Fig. 2, the colours of the films evolves from transparent (Fig. 2b inset) 
to light yellow (Fig. 2d inset) when the films prepared from the solution

G. Zhang et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
color. In contrast, matrix prepared from the solution of 2:1 exhibits fully 
covered morphology, this feature is further confirmed in large scale SEM 
image of this film (Fig. S5). The photograph of the CsPbBr3 film also 
exhibits uniform yellow color, demonstrating a uniform feature in a 
large scale. The UV–vis absorption spectrum of the Cs–Pb–Br film pre-
pared from the solution of 2:1 shows an onset at ~530 nm (Fig. S6). 
Fig. 4e shows the Tauc plot of the film prepared from the solution of 2:1. 
The optical bandgap (Eg) is fitted to be ~2.3 eV, which is consistent with 
previous reports [10,25,26]. The characteristic bandgap of CsPbBr3 can 
also be demonstrated by the steady PL spectrum (Fig. 4f), which shows 
an emission peak at ~536 nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap of 
~2.3 eV. These results demonstrate that our method is an effective way 
to prepare high-purity CsPbBr3  films through pre-introducing appro-
priate CsBr into PbBr2 solution. 
To examine the film performance in a full solution-processed device 
structure, we construct an HTL-free solar cell with a configuration of 
FTO/TiO2/CsPbBr3/Carbon.  Fig.  5a  presents  a  cross-sectional  SEM 
image of a solar cell sample, in which the CsPbBr3 films are prepared 
from the solution of 2:1. It clearly indicates that the CsPbBr3 grains are 
large enough to occupy the whole thickness of ~600 nm in active layer 
with dense arrangement. Fig. 5b shows the light J-V curves of the best 
PSCs prepared from different solutions. The PSC prepared from the so-
lution of 2:1 has a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.48%, with a 
short circuit current density (Jsc) of 7.16 mA cm(cid:0) 2, a fill factor (FF) of 
74.07%, and an open-circuit voltage Voc of 1.41 V. Whereas the best 
PSCs fabricated from the solution of 2:0 and 2:0.5 exhibit very low PCE 
of 0.99% and 3.73%, respectively. Other photovoltaic parameters from 
different PSCs are summarized in Table 1. This performance comparison 
shows the importance of enhancing the purity and coverage of CsPbBr3 
phase in active layer of solar cell. Fig. 5c is the steady-state output near 
the maximum power point of the best PSC of the 2:1 device. A steady 
photocurrent density of 5.65 mA cm(cid:0) 2 and a steady PCE of 6.44% were 
obtained at a bias voltage 1.14 V. It is noted that the steady PCE is 
slightly lower than the value extracted from J-V curve under the reverse 
scan. The deviation might come from the hysteresis behavior which is 
usually observed in common PSC devices [11,27–30] (Fig. S7). The IPCE 
spectrum of the optimized solar cell is recorded and shown in Fig. 5d. 
The  device  shows  strong  light  absorption  ability  in  the  range  of 
300–~525 nm. The Jsc  integrated from the IPCE spectra is 6.46 mA 
cm(cid:0) 2, which is a little lower than that obtained from the J-V curve. This 
discrepancy might be related to the nonlinear properties of perovskite 
films [31]. It should be noted that a high Voc of 1.5 V is achieved in a 
patch of PSCs prepared from the solution of 2:1. This value is one of the 
highest Voc for the CsPbBr3 solar cells based on unmodified configura-
tion FTO/TiO2/CsPbBr3/Carbon [32]. Fig. 5f summarizes the distribu-
tion of PCE collected from a series of PSCs. The average PCE is 5.86% of 
all samples demonstrating that our two-steps method is a reliable way to 
prepare efficient CsPbBr3 solar cells. 
The air stability of solar cells is also investigated. Fig. 6 shows the 
normalized photovoltaic parameters of an unencapsulated PSC under 
the open-air condition (T ~30 ◦C RH ~45%). The result shows that the 
photovoltaic parameters, including Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE, are still stable 
over 50 days. The best-performance PSC still shows a PCE of 6.81%, Voc 
of 1.41 V, Jsc  of 7.21 mA cm(cid:0) 2, and FF of 67% when it is stored in 
ambient condition for 90 days (see Fig. S8). The superior stability of 
CsPbBr3  solar cells makes it become a competitive candidate to the 
commercialization of PSCs. 
In summary, we fabricate high-quality CsPbBr3 films by using a facile 
two-step spin-coating method, in which CsBr is introduced into PbBr2 
solution in the first step. The pre-incorporated CsBr in PbBr2 solution can 
shorten the fabrication period and simplify the preparation process in 
comparison with the traditional dipping and multi-step solution pro-
cessing  methods.  The

of 2:1, which is close to the intrinsic yellow of the CsPbBr3 films. The 
UV/Vis absorption spectra of the films (see Fig. S2) also confirm the 
existence of CsPbBr3 in the films, which is evidenced by an absorbance 
onset  near  530  nm,  corresponding  to  the  bandgap  of  ~2.32  eV  for 
CsPbBr3 [21]. 
In order to learn the elements distribution in the films, we perform 
the  energy-dispersive  X-ray  spectroscopy  (EDX)  experiments  on  the 
films prepared from the solution of 2:1 (Fig. S3). Besides the element 
from the substrates (Ti and O), Cs, Pb and Br element are also detected in 
the films, showing the existence of Cs in the films. These results strongly 
demonstrate that the element of Cs and Br are successfully introduced 
into the films. Fig. 3b–d are the elemental mapping of Cs, Pb and Br in 
the films, showing a uniform distribution of those elements in the films. 
Combined with the elemental ratio of EDX data (see Table S1), it is found 
that Cs:Pb:Br is close to 1:2:5 coincided with elemental ratio of the 
precursor solution of 2:1. Those results demonstrate that it is an effective 
way to supply the Cs source by introducing CsBr into the PbBr2 solution 
in our first step treatment. 
Fig. 4a is the normalized XRD curves of the Cs–Pb–Br films prepared 
from different solutions after reacting with CsBr/2-methoxyethanol so-
lution,  followed  by  an  annealing  treatment.  Some  PbBr2  are  still 
remained in the Cs–Pb–Br films prepared from the solution of 2:0. There 
are very weak diffraction peaks of CsPbBr3 in the XRD pattern (blue line 
in Fig. 4a), indicating a tiny amount of CsPbBr3 exists in the films due to 
Cs element deficiency. The phase of CsPbBr3 begins to dominate in the 
Cs–Pb–Br films when 0.5 M CsBr is introduced into the PbBr2 solution in 
the first step, but still exists PbBr2-riched CsPb2Br5 phase in the film (red 
line in Fig. 4a). Therefore, it is necessary to supply Cs source so as to 
obtain single phase CsPbBr3 films. As expected, it produces pure CsPbBr3 
films when 1.0 M CsBr is added to the PbBr2  solution (dark line in 
Fig. 4a). By checking with EDX analysis (see Fig. S4 and Table S2), it is 
found that Cs, Pb and Br are uniform distributed and the ratio is close to 
1:1:3. Those results demonstrate that it is an effective way to get pure 
phase CsPbBr3. Fig. 4b to d show the morphology and related photos 
(inset figures) of the Cs–Pb–Br films after second step treatment. For the 
Cs–Pb–Br films prepared from the solution of 2:0, there are some small 
grains on the surface, which is different from the PbBr2 films prepared in 
the first step (Fig. 2b). These small grains may be CsPbBr3 grains, which 
is evidenced by the yellow dots on the films. There are apparent cracks 
in the Cs–Pb–Br films fabricated from the solution of 2:0.5 (Fig. 4c), 
which is consistent with the morphology of the mother matrix in the first 
step (Fig. 2c). The cracks in the Cs–Pb–Br films can act as the current- 
shunting pathways, leading to a serious current leakage and recombi-
nation loss [22–24]. Meanwhile, the film exhibits nonuniform yellow

mized samples can achieve a power conversion efficiency of 7.48%, with 
high stability in air conditions. These results demonstrate the efficient 
and time-saving method for preparation of CsPbBr3 films in this work 
has a promising application in various optoelectronic devices.
