In this paper, we demonstrate that the performance of perovskite solar cells can be largely boosted with sub-nm
pyridine-containing small-molecule electron interfacial layers. These vacuum-deposited sub-nm layers between
perovskites and electron transport layers create a permanent dipole moment that improves the interfacial
energy level alignment and facilitates a fast electron sweep-out. With these interfacial layers, the devices exhibit
exceptional power conversion eﬃciencies up to 18.8%, a 25% increase compared to that of the one without the
interfacial layer.

Recently, halide perovskite semiconductors have attracted a great
amount of attention because of their unique optoelectronic properties
and potential applications in solar and dim-light energy conversion,
light emission, lasing, transistors, and sensors [1–11]. Compared to
current mainstream group IV and III–V semiconductors, halide
perovskite thin ﬁlms can be fabricated at much lower temperatures,
which makes them suitable for low-cost and large-area production.
Similar to aromatic organic semiconductors, semiconducting perovs-
kite thin ﬁlms can be fabricated by either solvent-based solution
processes or solvent-free vacuum deposition. Owing to the diﬀerent
characteristics of deposition methods, two distinct approaches have
been applied to solution-processed and vacuum-deposited perovskites
to achieve high device performance. In the solution process, a complex
perovskite composition can easily be realized by the mixture of
perovskite precursor solutions, while in the vacuum process, without
the issue of dissolution, eﬀortless deposition of multiple layers is
usually achieved [12]. In vacuum-deposition organic light-emitting
diodes, sub-nanometer to few-nanometer interfacial layers, such as
inorganic materials, MoOx, CsF,
and conjugated compounds,
1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylene hexacarbonitrile (HAT-CN) and 8-
hydroxyquinolinato lithium (Liq), have been widely used for the
eﬀective injection of holes or electrons [13–16]. In this paper, we
demonstrate that by taking the advantages of precise thickness control
and solution-free layer-by-layer stacking, of the vacuum deposition,

performance of perovskite solar cells can be largely boosted with sub-
nm small-molecule electron interfacial layers (EILs). These vacuum-
deposited sub-nm layers between perovskites and electron transport
layers (ETLs) create a permanent dipole moment that improves the
interfacial energy level alignment and facilitates a fast electron sweep-
out. All perovskite solar cell performance parameters, including short-
circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), and ﬁll factor
(FF), can be simultaneously enhanced, resulting in a 24.5% increase in
power conversion eﬃciency (PCE).

The devices were prepared on cleaned indium tin oxide (ITO)
substrates. The substrates were then loaded into a high vacuum
chamber (base pressure < 1 × 10–6 Torr) to deposit MoO3 and
tris[4-(5-phenylthiophen-2-yl)phenyl]amine) (TPTPA) thin ﬁlms layer
by layer, and the perovskite ﬁlms were then fabricated by sequential
vacuum deposition, which is reported in another paper [2]. After the
formation of perovskite, we deposited 1,3,5-Tri[(3-pyridyl)-phen-3-yl]
benzene (TmPyPB), 4,6-Bis(3,5-di(pyridin-4-yl)phenyl)-2-methylpyri-
midine (B4PyMPM), and Tris(2,4,6-trimethyl-3-(pyridin-3-yl)phenyl)
borane (3TPYMB) as EILs respectively. During the interfacial layer
deposition, the deposition rate was maintained at 0.1 Å s−1. After that,
C60, TmPyPB, and Ag were deposited layer by layer. The thicknesses of

the organic layers were all carefully calibrated by using spectroscopic
ellipsometry. The devices were conﬁgured as glass substrate/ITO
(145 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/TPTPA (10 nm)/CH3NH3PbI3 (370 nm) /EIL
(0.5 nm)/C60 (90 nm)/TmPyPB (7 nm)/Ag (150 nm). The device areas
(0.051 cm2) were deﬁned by shadow masks. The devices were encap-
sulated using UV-cured sealant (Everwide Chemical Co.) and cover
glasses after fabrication, and were subsequently characterized in air.
2.
The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured using a
Keithley 2636B SourceMeter in the dark and under AM1.5 G simulated
solar illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun, calibrated
by an NREL-traceable KG5-ﬁltered silicon reference cell). Normally,
the scan direction travels from the positive to negative bias with a step
size of 10 mV and a delay time between points of 300 ms. The external
quantum eﬃciency (EQE) spectra were acquired by illuminating the
solar cells with chopped monochromatic light with continuous-wave-
biased white light (from a halogen lamp). The photocurrent signals
were extracted with the lock-in technique using a Stanford Research
System current preampliﬁer followed by an Ametek lock-in ampliﬁer.
The intensity of the monochromatic light was calibrated with a NIST-
traceable Ophir power meter. Transient photocurrent and transient
photovoltage measurements were performed using the second harmo-
nic of a Nd:YAG laser (532 nm) as an excitation source. A 100 W
variable-intensity halogen lamp was used as the bias light. The
transient photocurrent signals were ampliﬁed using a variable-gain
high-speed current ampliﬁer (FEMTO, DHPCA-100), and the transient
signals were recorded using a Tektronix oscilloscope (DPO3050).
Averages of 256 traces were calculated to improve the signal-to-noise
ratio. The average lifetimes were ﬁtted with bi-exponential decay
functions.
2.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were measured with a
Bruker Dimension Icon® Atomic Force Microscope operating in a
tapping mode. Photoemission measurements were conducted in two
connected ultrahigh vacuum chambers, one for organic thermal
deposition and the other for spectroscopic analysis with a base pressure
of 1 × 10–9 Torr. To avoid the diﬀerence induced by processing
conditions, the perovskite ﬁlms were prepared simultaneously and
were then stored in a nitrogen atmosphere. The prepared perovskite
ﬁlm was loaded into the analysis chamber as quick as possible after
exposure to the air to prevent contamination. C60 and 3TPYMB were
thermally deposited on the perovskite ﬁlm under a pressure of 5 × 10–
7 Torr with a deposition rate of 0.2 Å/s using a Sycon STM-100 crystal
thickness monitor, and the XPS and UPS spectra were acquired
immediately after every deposition. The valance-band UV photoemis-
sion spectra were obtained using HeI (21.2 eV) as the excitation source
and photoemitted electrons were counted by a hemispherical analyzer
with an overall resolution of 0.05 eV. The absolute energy scale of the
UPS and XPS spectra is relative to the Fermi edge and the 4f core level
of a sputter-cleaned gold substrate, respectively. To eliminate the
analyzer eﬀect, a sample bias of −5 eV was applied when acquiring
the secondary electron cutoﬀ spectra.

Geometric optimizations were carried out with density functional
theory implemented in the Gaussian 09 package. Becke's three-para-
meter functional combined with Lee, Yang, and Parr's hybrid exchange
correlation functional (B3LYP) with the 6–31G* basic set was utilized
for all atoms. Harmonic vibrational frequencies were performed on the
optimized geometries to conﬁrm energetic minima. The molecular

dipole moment was evaluated at the lowest energy conformation.
Fig. 1a displays the device structure of the solar cells used in this
study. Vacuum-sublimable small-molecule electron transporting ma-
terials, TmPyPB, B4PyMPM, and 3TPYMB were inserted between the
vacuum-deposited CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite active layer and C60 ETL.
The molecular structures of the electron interfacial materials are
displayed in Fig. 1b. Fig. 1c displays the energy band diagram. The
interfacial materials used all possess high-energy bandgaps with low-
lying HOMO and high-lying LUMO levels. The low-lying HOMO levels
may block the photogenerated holes from diﬀusing to the C60 ETLs.
However, the high-lying LUMO levels also inhibit the electrons from
transporting to the C60 ETLs; hence, it is possible that the tunneling
mechanism is operational in the eﬃcient devices [17,18].
In previous EIL studies, the interfacial layers were usually fabri-

numbers in the brackets show the ﬁtted curves and the average transient lifetimes.
cated before the coating of the perovskite active layer [19–22]. In
consequence, the insertion of the interfacial layer between the electron
transporting and perovskite layer not only aﬀects the energy levels but
also extensively alters the morphology and crystallinity of the upper
perovskite ﬁlm [19–22]. Although many have reported very eﬃcient
device eﬃciency improvements by the interfacial layers, it is very
diﬃcult to separate their energetic and morphological eﬀects. In
contrast, in this study, the EILs were vacuum-deposited after fabricat-
ing the perovskite active layers. Therefore, the devices with various
interfacial layers and the reference cell without an interfacial layer
possessed identical perovskite morphologies, and thus, any perfor-
mance improvement was due to the mechanisms other than the
perovskite morphological controls. In contrast, the perovskite ﬁlms
with ultrathin sub-nm EILs in this study exhibited identical morphol-
ogy as indicated in Fig. S1, implying the eﬀects of the EILs are purely
energetic.
Fig. 2a displays the solar cell J–V characteristics of the devices
without and with 0.5-nm EILs under a simulated illumination of 1 sun.
The performance parameters are summarized in Table 1 and their EQE
spectra are presented in Fig. S2 in the supporting information.
Intriguingly, 3TPYMB, B4PyMPM, and TmPyPB devices exhibit clear
improvements compared with the best reference cell without EIL. The
common characteristic of 3TPYMB, B4PyMPM, and TmPyPB are that
they all consist of pyridine chromophores. Notably, the device with the
3TPYMB interfacial layer exhibited a high JSC of 22.7 mA/cm2, VOC of
1.07 V, FF of 0.77, and PCE of 18.8%, which corresponds to 6.6%,
2.9%, 13.5%, and 24.5% enhancements in JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE,
respectively. The device also exhibited a high stabilized PCE of 18.7%
and no J–V sweeping hysteresis, as shown in Fig. 2b. The B4PyMPM

and TmPyPB also exhibited negligible hysteresis, as indicated in Fig. S3
in the supporting information. The J–V characteristics of the TmPyPB,
B4PyMPM and 3TPYMB devices of diﬀerent delay times in between the
voltage points are shown in Fig. S4–S6. Negligible hysteresis was found
at all sweeping speeds. The approximately 19% PCE in both the J–V
sweeping and stabilized PCEs of the 3TPYMB cells are among the
highest values reported in vacuum-deposited perovskite solar cells and
are a step closer to state-of-the-art solution-processed devices (PCE
22.1%) [23].
To further investigate the origins of the performance improvement
of the 3TPYMB champion cell, transient photocurrent and transient
photovoltage measurements were performed. As shown in Fig. 3a, the
device with the 3TPYMB interfacial layer exhibited a faster transient
photocurrent decay (with a decay lifetime of 0.17 μs) than the device
without the interfacial layer (decay lifetime = 0.24 μs), revealing that
the carrier extraction eﬃciency was enhanced by the incorporation of

the 3TPYMB interfacial layer. Fig. 3b displays the transient photo-
voltage measurement results. The extracted average recombination
lifetimes are 0.72 and 0.64 μs for the 3TPYMB device and the reference
device without interfacial layer, respectively. The retarded recombina-
tion rate indicates a slower carrier recombination rate in the 3TPYMB
device, which also explains the improvement in VOC and FF of the
3TPYMB device in the J–V measurement. The photocurrent density
(Jph) vs. eﬀective voltage (VO-V, where V is the applied voltage and VO
is the voltage at which Jph = 0) plot is shown in Fig. S7. The 3TPYMB
device exhibited smaller slopes at both high eﬀective voltage (0.2 V <
VO-V < 1.1 V) and lower eﬀective voltage (0.04 V < VO-V < 0.2 V)
ranges compared with the reference cell. These results also suggest an
improved carrier transport and the minimization of the recombination.
With the above-mentioned measurement results, the fast electron
sweep-out and retarded recombination natures of the 3TPYMB device
were conﬁrmed. We suspected that these preferable characteristics
were caused by the interfacial dipoles created by the vacuum-deposited
sub-nm 3TPYMB layer. Hence, in-situ UV and X-ray photoemission
spectroscopies (UPS and XPS) were utilized to investigate the energy-
level evolution. 3TPYMB and C60 were incrementally deposited in-situ
on the perovskite ﬁlm and XPS and UPS spectra were acquired after
each deposition. Fig. 4a and b show the evolution of the valence band
(left panel) and vacuum level (VL) position (right panel) of the
perovskite/C60 and perovskite/0.5 nm 3TPYMB/C60 thin ﬁlms, respec-
tively. The valence band maximum (VBM) (or HOMO) and work
function (WF) were extracted by linearly extrapolating the leading
edge of the VB and the onset of the secondary cutoﬀ to the background,
respectively. The conduction band maximum and LUMO were deter-
mined by considering the optical band gaps of the materials. The VBM
(or HOMO) and WF were about 1.1 and 4.5 eV for the pristine
perovskite ﬁlm and approximately 1.4 and 5.0 eV for the bare C60,
respectively, in the perovskite. These values are consistent with the
published values in the literature for the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and
C60 thin ﬁlms [24]. Fig. 4c and d illustrate the interfacial electronic
structures of the perovskite/C60 and perovskite/0.5 nm 3TPYMB/C60
thin ﬁlms extracted from the UPS and XPS (shown in Fig. S8)
measurements. In the perovskite/C60 sample,
the very ﬁrst C60
deposition leads to a 0.2 eV downward shift in VL, which is in
accordance with the previous report and is attributed to the charge-
transfer-induced interfacial dipole formation at the perovskite/C60
interface [25]. Notably, by the introduction of a 0.5 nm 3TPYMB, an
even higher 0.4 eV downward shift in VL is observed. In addition, a
smaller 0.3 eV shift in the C60 HOMO peak is noted in the perovskite/
0.5 nm 3TPYMB/C60 sample compared with the value of 0.4 eV in the
perovskite/C60 sample. The results can be ascribed to a smaller band
bending in C60 in the perovskite/0.5 nm 3TPYMB/C60 sample. By
incorporating a 0.5-nm 3TPYMB between the perovskite and C60, a
much stronger interfacial dipole was formed at the perovskite/C60
interface and less band bending was observed in the C60 region. Both
facilitate eﬀortless electron transportation from the perovskite layer
towards the cathode.
The strong interfacial dipoles formed by sub-nm EILs were believed
to be related to a preferable molecular orientation upon vacuum
deposition. The direction of permanent dipole moments with respect
to the 3TPYMB, B4PyMPM, and TmPyPB molecules were calculated
and are displayed in Fig. S9 in the supporting information. With the
interfacial energy band structures and computed molecular dipole
moments, we plotted the illustration of the 0.5-nm vacuum-deposited
3TPYMB molecules on the perovskite underlayer, as shown in Fig. 4e.
The 3TPYMB molecules substantially exhibited a preferable orientation
with the permanent dipole moments pointed outwards, resulting in a
stronger interfacial dipole of 0.4 eV pointed outwards towards the
cathode direction. When further increasing the 3TPYMB, B4PyMPM,
and TmPyPB layer thicknesses, the device performance gradually
decreased, and the results are presented in Fig. S10. These results
indicate that the preferable orientation of the vacuum deposited
interfacial layers only occurs in the ﬁrst few angstroms of the ﬁlms,
presumably due to the interaction of the perovskite surface and the
deposited molecules.
In summary, we demonstrated that by the insertion of vacuum-
deposited sub-nm pyridine-containing EILs, the performance of per-
ovskite solar cells can largely be increased to approximately 19% PCE, a
25% increase compared to that of the one without the interfacial layer.
The UPS and XPS results indicated that the eﬀect of these interfacial
layers was the creation of a strong interfacial dipole, which was
beneﬁcial to the photoelectron extraction towards external circuitry.
The retarded carrier recombination and fast carrier sweep-out were
also conﬁrmed by transient photovoltage and transient photocurrent
measurements. Owing to the layer-by-layer deposition and underlayer-
insensitive natures of vacuum sublimation, we envision that these
vacuum-deposited sub-nm EILs can be universally applied to various
kinds of vacuum-deposited as well as solution-processed perovskite
active layers of a variety of compositions.
